    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb11` because it contains a loop structure (`br i1 %i13, label %bb14, label %bb22`) and is revisited multiple times during the iteration.\n  - `bb14` and `bb20` are part of the loop body, so they are also executed frequently, but slightly less than `bb11` due to loop control overhead.\n  - `bb22` is the loop exit block, executed once after the loop finishes.\n  - `bb8` is executed once for file operations before entering the loop.\n  - `bb23` is the final block, executed once at the end of the function.\n  - `bb5` is executed only if the file opening fails, which is less likely in normal scenarios.\n  - `bb` is the entry block, executed only once at the start."
