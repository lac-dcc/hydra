    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb14` because it contains the main loop that iterates over the key schedule and processes 18 iterations, making it the most frequently executed block.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, `bb38`, and `bb46` are part of the inner loop and are executed multiple times per iteration, making them hotter than others.\n  - Blocks like `bb53`, `bb71`, and `bb89` are executed only once, placing them among the least hot blocks.\n  - The critical edge blocks (e.g., `bb16.bb22_crit_edge`) are less likely to dominate execution frequency compared to their parent blocks."
