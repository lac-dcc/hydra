Blocks like `bb83` and `bb38` are also part of the loop and are executed frequently.\n  - Blocks such as `bb45` and its successors (`bb81`, `bb57`, etc.) are part of a switch-case structure, which is likely executed multiple times within the loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb191` and `bb` are less likely to be executed as often because they are outside the main loop or are part of cleanup/exit paths."
