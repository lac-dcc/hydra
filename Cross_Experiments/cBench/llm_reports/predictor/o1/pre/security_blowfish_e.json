    "additionalNotes": "- The \"hotness\" of a basic block is determined by analyzing the control flow and loop structure. Blocks within loops, especially the innermost loops, are likely to be executed more frequently. \n  - `bb14` is the entry point of the main loop that iterates over 18 elements, making it the hottest block.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, `bb38`, and `bb46` are part of the loop body and are executed repeatedly, contributing to their high hotness.\n  - Blocks like `bb56`, `bb58`, `bb69`, `bb74`, and `bb76` are part of subsequent loops, making them moderately hot.\n  - Blocks like `bb11`, `bb.bb11_crit_edge`, and `bb10` are executed less frequently as they are part of the setup or conditional checks.\n  - Blocks like `bb53`, `bb71`, and `bb89` are executed only once or are part of the function's exit, making them the least hot."
