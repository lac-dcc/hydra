    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb11` because it contains a loop structure (`phi` node and back edge to itself via `bb20`), which is likely to execute multiple iterations depending on the value of `%i`.\n  - `bb14` and `bb20` are part of the loop, so they are also hot but slightly less frequent than `bb11` due to the loop's control flow.\n  - `bb22` is executed after the loop exits, making it less hot than the loop blocks.\n  - `bb8` is executed once after the file is successfully opened, making it cooler than the loop-related blocks.\n  - `bb23` is the function's exit block, executed once, making it cooler than `bb8`.\n  - `bb5` is executed only if the file fails to open, which is less likely in normal scenarios.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once, making it the least hot."
