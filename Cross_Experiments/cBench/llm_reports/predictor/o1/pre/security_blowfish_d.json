    "additionalNotes": "- The \"hotness\" of a basic block is determined by analyzing the control flow and loop structure of the function. Blocks within loops, especially inner loops, are likely to be executed more frequently.\n  - `bb14` is the hottest block because it is the header of the innermost loop that iterates over 18 elements, making it the most frequently executed block.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, and `bb38` are part of the same loop and are also executed frequently, but slightly less than `bb14` due to loop exits and conditions.\n  - Blocks outside loops, such as `bb`, `bb89`, and `bb71`, are executed less frequently and are ranked lower."
