    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block `bb43` is part of a loop that processes input data from a file, making it likely to be executed repeatedly.\n  - Blocks like `bb49`, `bb51`, `bb57`, and `bb63` are also part of loops and are expected to have high execution frequencies.\n  - Blocks such as `bb16`, `bb23`, `bb31`, and `bb152` handle error conditions and are less likely to be executed frequently.\n  - The ranking assumes typical program behavior where loops dominate execution time, and error-handling paths are less frequently taken."
