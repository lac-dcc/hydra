    "additionalNotes": "- The \"hotness\" of a basic block is determined by analyzing the control flow and loop structure. Blocks inside loops are generally hotter, with the innermost loop blocks being the hottest.\n  - `bb14` is the hottest because it is the header of the main loop iterating over 18 elements, and it dominates the execution flow of the function.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, and `bb38` are part of the loop body and are executed frequently, making them hotter than others.\n  - Blocks like `bb53`, `bb71`, and `bb89` are executed less frequently as they are outside the main loops or are terminal blocks."
