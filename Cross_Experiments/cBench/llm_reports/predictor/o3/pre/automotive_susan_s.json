Their hotness depends on the loop's behavior, but they are less likely to execute as often as `bb4`.\n  - `bb55` is the loop latch, responsible for incrementing the loop variable and branching back to `bb4`. It is executed once per loop iteration, making it less hot than the loop body blocks.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once at the start of the function.\n  - `bb56` is the exit block and is executed only once when the loop terminates.
