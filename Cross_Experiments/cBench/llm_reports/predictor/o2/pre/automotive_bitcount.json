    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb14` because it is part of the loop structure, and loops typically dominate execution frequency in programs. The loop iterates based on the comparison between `%.01` and `%i12`, making `bb14` and `bb20` the most frequently executed blocks.\n  - `bb20` is the second hottest because it is the continuation of the loop and feeds back into `bb11`.\n  - `bb11` is the loop header and is executed once per iteration, making it the third hottest.\n  - `bb8` is executed once if the file opens successfully, making it less hot than the loop blocks.\n  - `bb22` and `bb23` are executed after the loop exits, with `bb23` being the final block.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once.\n  - `bb5` is executed only if the file fails to open, making it the least hot block."
