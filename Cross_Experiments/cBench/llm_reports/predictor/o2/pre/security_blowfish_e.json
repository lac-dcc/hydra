    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb14` because it contains the main loop that iterates over the key schedule and processes 18 iterations, making it the most frequently executed block.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, `bb38`, and `bb46` are part of the inner loop and are executed multiple times per iteration, making them hotter than others.\n  - Blocks like `bb56`, `bb58`, `bb69`, `bb74`, and `bb76` are part of the secondary loop for processing the expanded key schedule, making them moderately hot.\n  - Blocks like `bb11`, `bb.bb11_crit_edge`, and others are executed less frequently as they are part of setup or conditional branches.\n  - Blocks like `bb`, `bb71`, and `bb89` are executed only once, making them the least hot."
