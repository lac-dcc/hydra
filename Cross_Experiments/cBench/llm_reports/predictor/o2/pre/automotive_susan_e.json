This block is likely executed the most due to its position in the innermost loop.\n  - Blocks with `.crit_edge` suffixes are less likely to be hot as they represent critical edges in the control flow graph, which are typically executed less frequently than the main loop blocks.\n  - The ranking assumes that the function's execution is dominated by the nested loops, and the control flow follows the most common paths."

    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb36` because it contains a loop structure (`br label %bb36, !llvm.loop !54`) and is the main driver of the function's iterative behavior. Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function.\n  - Blocks like `bb83` and `bb38` are also likely to be hot due to their proximity to the loop and their role in controlling the flow of the loop.\n  - Blocks such as `bb45` and `bb81` are part of a switch-case structure, which can be frequently executed depending on the input.\n  - Blocks like `bb90` and `bb191` are part of the final stages of the function and are executed after the loop, making them less hot than the loop itself but still significant.\n  - Blocks like `bb32`, `bb33`, and `bb82` are less likely to be executed frequently as they are part of the initial setup or error handling paths."
