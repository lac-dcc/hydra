    "additionalNotes": "- The basic block `bb4` is the loop header and contains a back edge to itself, making it the most frequently executed block as it governs the loop iteration.\n  - `bb9` is the next most likely to be executed since it is directly dependent on the condition in `bb4` and leads to further processing.\n  - `bb11` and `bb40` are executed based on the branching condition in `bb9`, with `bb11` likely being slightly hotter due to the structure of the code.\n  - `bb55` is the loop latch block, which updates the loop variable and branches back to `bb4`, making it less hot than the loop body but still significant.\n  - `bb56` is the exit block of the loop and is executed only once when the loop terminates.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once at the start of the function."
