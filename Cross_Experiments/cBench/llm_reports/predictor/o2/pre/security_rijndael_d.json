    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb29` because it contains a loop structure that iterates over a range of values, making it likely to execute the most frequently.\n  - Blocks like `bb68`, `bb37`, and `bb31` are also part of the loop and are expected to be executed frequently.\n  - Blocks such as `bb24`, `bb65`, and `bb83` are less likely to be executed often as they are part of error handling or less common control flow paths.\n  - The ranking assumes typical execution patterns based on the structure of the code, but actual hotness may vary depending on runtime inputs."

    "additionalNotes": "- The loop structure in `bb11` and `bb16` suggests that these blocks are part of an iterative process, making them the hottest. Specifically, `bb16` increments the loop counter and branches back to `bb11`, which checks the loop condition.\n  - `bb14` is executed within the loop, but only when the condition in `bb11` is true, so it is slightly less hot than `bb11` and `bb16`.\n  - `bb8` is executed once if the file opens successfully, making it less hot than the loop blocks.\n  - `bb18` and `bb19` are executed after the loop, with `bb19` being the final block, so they are cooler.\n  - `bb` is the entry block, executed once, and `bb5` is executed only if the file fails to open, making it the coldest block."
