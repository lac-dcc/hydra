    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb14` because it contains the main loop that iterates over the key schedule setup, which is likely to dominate execution time.\n  - Blocks like `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, and `bb38` are part of the inner loop and are executed repeatedly, making them hotter than others.\n  - Blocks such as `bb53`, `bb71`, and `bb89` are executed only once or are part of less frequent control flow paths, making them colder."
