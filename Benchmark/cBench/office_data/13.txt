 Toxictoy writes "Imagine having a disease that is so controversial that doctors 
refuse to treat you. Individuals with this disease report disturbing crawling, 
stinging, and biting sensations, as well as non-healing skin lesions, which are 
associated with highly unusual structures. These structures can be described as 
fiber-like or filamentous, and are the most striking feature of this disease. In 
addition, patients report the presence of seed-like granules and black 
speck-like material associated with their skin. Sound like a bad plot for a 
Sci-Fi channel movie? Think again - it could be Morgellon's Syndrome."

    The success will be similar to what dermatology proper can achieve anyway. 
    Modern dermatology cannot cure eczema. Most varieties of psoriasis are 
    uncurable as well. Add in neurodermatitis and a few other skin conditions 
    and you get a fairly long list of conditions which the doctors cannot deal 
    with. They poke at it from different angles like tribal shamans and the 
    success rate is about the same. The reality is that we know so little about 
    the human skin, it is not even funny. Just take Pimecrolimus and eczema. 
    Nobody has even the faintest idea why it works. Staph and eczema? What is 
    the cause and what is the effect? So on so fourth. I read the RTFA and I can 
    understand some of the patients described in it who are taking a gun to a 
    dermatologist appointment. I have wanted to do that on couple of occasions 
    myself.

      Modern dermatology cannot cure eczema.

      I've cured my own eczema enough that it doesn't bother me for about 
      10months out of 12. How? Its a selection of things, but the worse problem 
      for mine was when the air was humid it would go mental.

      Also im alerigic to ALOT of shampoos, conditoners and clothes treatment 
      stuff.

      Problem is the world doesn't have any time on its hands to find out what 
      causes the problems, so it never knows WHY it has this problem. If you 
      want to stop your excema do as i did, keep an diary and think carefully of 
      what you've eaten, done, where you have been, what your wearing, when were 
      those clothes last washed?

      I find the longer i leave my jeans unwashed, the less problems they cause 
      me!. Why this is im not sure but it works fine, i just spray them down 
      with some Kleezne stuff to make them smell normal (not that they need it 
      really).
      Nylon causes me no end of problems due to my skin sweating, causing it to 
      get worse.

      Dont RUB your skin dry, pat it instead or getting a toweled dressing gown 
      and wear that and just let your body air dry, its far nicer on your skin.

      Good luck!

        Sounds very similar to what I did to cure mine. Avoid all shampoos with 
        parfum/perfume, same with soaps and the like. I use a dead sea mud soap 
        which my skin loves and it kills my fungal psoriasis dead. I also use 
        Pears transparent soap on my face and let myself dry in a towelled 
        dressing gown. As a result my skin is in the best state its been in, in 
        years. My dermatologist hadn't the time to be arsed, so I did this all 
        myself with trial and error like the above poster.

        I don't think that's considered "curing". Your skin problem is still 
        there just that you minimize the chances of it occurring.

      Good points! Incredible how important the human body's largest organ is 
      and we know so little.

      Isn't leprosy still on the "uncurable" list? Is it even on the 
      "containable"; i.e., halt it where it is, point? akin to tuberculosis. My 
      mom got it when she was young and as a school teacher, has to get x-rays 
      of her lungs every year to show it's still dormant.

      One other area to touch on is rehashed so often you'd think people catch 
      on: misuse of anti-bacteria related issues...yet there are a lot of 
      peabrains running loose in an unorganized conspiracy to sink modern 
      medicine. You'd think all of the parties involved were backwoods 
      hillbillies with no educations, IQs smaller than their shoe size, and 
      fewer teeth than toes.[1] 
      There are three guilty parties: 1) patients; 2) doctors; 3) people in 
      general. 
      1. Patients are guilty because they think doctors are just quoting a 
      pamphlet when they tell them, "take all of the pills, don't stop just 
      because you start feeling better." And what do people do? that's a 
      rhetorical question. Boom. Compromised antibiotic.

      2a. Doctors are guilty because patients come to them when they are ill and 
      it's a cold. The patients harangue them into giving them an antibiotic 
      because they think it'll make them feel better, despite Dr. Quack telling 
      them antibiotics don't work with viruses. Finally, the script pad comes 
      out and voila! Compromised antibiotic!

      2b. Doctors are also guilty because each hospital has at least one group 
      where the medical staff and pharmacy administration interact; e.g., "P&T" 
      (Pharmacy & Therapeutics). Issues such as what the formulary items should 
      be, how to deal with non-formulary items, and importantly: what drugs can 
      be administered when. It's supposed to be binding, but doctors don't work 
      for hospitals, so they'll basically do what they want when it comes to 
      that type of thing. The policy can be to only use some new antibiotic for 
      specific patients or diseases|cases and doctors will be more concerned if 
      their shoe is untied when they place the script for the brand new 
      bug-killer and can proudly tell the patient, "We've got somoething brand 
      new and it's going to make you feel a lot better very soon." Shazam! The 
      beginning of the end of that antibiotic. Another compromised antibiotic.

      3. Society in general and the marketing departments of various household 
      goods: all of the various soaps & cleansers which promise to kill bugs 
      when you use them. You're only supposed to use soap to clean your hands 
      off - remove the stuff which doesn't belong there - remove as in get it 
      off of your hands, not kill some of the bugs and leave a small number of 
      immune ones in place. Eugenics takes over and we begin breeding superbugs.


      [1] Wait. Isn't that a description of NASCAR fans? Sorry for the mixup.

        Everything you say is good up until here.

        Antibacterial soaps are a marketing ploy and nothing more...all soaps 
        are antibacterial. How well a given soap removes bacteria from your 
        hands is directly proportional to how well you clean your hands (i.e: do 
        you just get them wet, or do you really soap up and scrub them down). 
        Bacteria aren't some magical things that can survive the same conditions 
        that will remove dirt, grime, oil, protein, salt, and metals from your 
        hands. Some companies throw in a little bit of antiseptic to get people 
        to buy their soap, but it is no more or less effective than regular 
        soap, and at the concentrations present, it is highly unlikely to cause 
        resistant bacterial strains to develop.

      I suffer from seborrhaic dermatitis. For years I had no success with 
      doctors' treatments which generally had bad side effects. Then I gave up 
      sucrose and junk food and was effectively cured. No doctor ever mentioned 
      this and it turns out that there's a group of people on yahoo who advocate 
      this treatment. It works pretty much 100% of the time, according to those 
      guys. This has made me a lot more cynical about the medical profession and 
      its relationship with business. It's in no-one's financial interest to 
      advocate a cheap and simple cure that involves _not_ buying and consuming 
      refined foods, except the patient - not the doctor, not the food industry, 
      not the makers of creams etc..

    is a serious issue. 
    In the issue at hand, there may be a common, tangible factor causing the 
    numerous instances of Morgellon's Syndrome. Given the horrendous amount of 
    chemicals that accumulate in non-organic foods, would anyone be surprised 
    that these chemicals may be affecting the operation of the human brain? 
    Has anyone done an analysis of the types of food that victims (of

      Something that used to cause bizarre delusions, hallucinations, and 
      misperceptions in mideival times was tainted rye bread [wikipedia.org].

      Some of these things _really_ sound like a bad acid trip to me. I'm not 
      kidding---what if these people do have some bizarre infectious agent that 
      causes rashes and secretes hallucinogenic agents into the bloodstream, 
      making the rashes appear to be outlandish and twirl out of the skin and 
      dance around inside your arms?

      Hallucinogens as potent as LSD-25 are extremely difficult to detect. If 
      this is a new, unusual, and very strong hallucinogen (perhaps one that 
      doesn't cause the notorious pupil dilatation that would normally be a 
      tip-off of a chemically-altered mental state) secreted by an infectious 
      agent, it would all add up, at least in my eyes.

      Has this possibility even been investigated? It would also be consistent 
      with the disease being treatable with BOTH anti-infectious and 
      anti-psychotic methods.

      Of course, this doesn't entirely explain the pictures on the MRF 
      website... but perhaps some of the things being labelled as Morgellons 
      don't involve the same infectious agent at all.

      Given the horrendous amount of chemicals that accumulate in non-organic 
      foods 

      As compared to the ridiculously small amount of chemicals that accumulate 
      in "organic" food, perhaps? Everything material is "chemical", all matter 
      is composed of chemical elements. It's ridiculous to assume that a 
      chemical compound is automatically suspect of being dangerous if it was 
      produced in a human factory instead of a plant or animal in nature.

      Think of all the extremely toxic chemical compounds found in nature: 
      snakes, spiders, scorpions, mushrooms, salmonella, botulism, anthrax. 
      Think of curare, strychnine, nicotine, nature produces many toxins that 
      are more dangerous than the most mortal chemical weapon of mass 
      destruction man has invented.

  If you have strange sores, or another infection, a biopsy will reveal 
  abnormalities. The fact the CDC has not been sent any sample by a trained 
  medical professional (or so the article claims), leads me to question the 
  validity of the claims. There -are- procedures in place to deal with 
  undiagnosed infections.

  I'm not seeing the story here, and I'm reluctant to believe there is a grand 
  conspiracy keeping a single sample from making it to the CDC.

    Partially off topic: I have an undiagnosed skin infection that's flummoxed 
    more than a dozen real doctors in real clinics and hospitals for more than a 
    year. BUT it's not spreading, only verly slowly leaving soem ugly scarring 
    on the affected skin. I've been through viral id and fungal tests (all 
    negative) but since they determined only by elimination that the cellulitis 
    must be bacterial, I can't get any of the GP or dermatologists to do 
    anything but throw antibiotics at me. More than 10 courses of antibiotics 
    later (including Cipro and topical Clindamyacin), I'm basically just 
    containing the infection and slowly accumulating more scar tissue.

    ...But I can't seem to get anyone to do a damn culture. I've never before 
    been refused a referral, but I get the brush-off or referral to unavailable 
    doctors when I request the one thing that could simply identify the problem. 
    Short of calling the CDC and sounding like a kook, what's a guy to do when 
    the local medical resources just aren't interested in your weird condition 
    because you're neither particularly interesting, nor actively dying?

      Step 1: Get a written statement from one, two, or perferably, three GP's 
      or dermatologists you have an undiagnosable skin condition or other 
      aliment that is not psychological in nature.

      Step 2: Get a phone book or google and find out the nearest university 
      medical research center in your geographic area.

      Step 3: Armed with the affadavits in Step 1, contact professors at the 
      university specializing in pathology, dermatology, biology.. just about 
      any -ology except geology, or phrenology, haha. You might have to try a 
      couple, but you WILL find someone interested in your case. Those people 
      have the training, resources, and credentials to find out if there is 
      something novel about your condition. They will pay you no mind without 
      Step 1.

      Good luck.

        You likely won't get past step 1.

        I have a rare medical condition (type of intersex condition). Visably 
        androgynous patients tend to get treated pretty poorly by the medical 
        profession (mostly due to anti-gay prejudice.) Although gay or HIV+ 
        patients can usually find a doctor, even "gay-friendly" doctors don't 
        want to deal with intersex patients.

        The problem is 1) Most doctors don't want to deal with patients with 
        rare conditions because they take up a lot of time, taking time away 
        from other patients, 2) Doctors don't want to order lab tests, MRIs, etc 
        for rare conditions because they fear insurance companies will deny it, 
        3) When they do order tests, they try to come up with a very vague 
        diagnosis to see if they can sneak it by the insurance, and 4) Doctors 
        never want to make a written statement that "Patient X has a rare 
        disease" because they might have to defend it later.

        So since you have no written diagnosis, and no evidence, no researcher 
        will pay attention to you.

  Or it could be the crazies have found one of the internets again.

  My local hospital had a patient reporting something very similar - claimed 
  that bugs were eating her and her son, and she was itching all over. 
  Examination showed she did, in fact, have rashes - from direct self-inflicted 
  skin irritation - and the 'bugs' she'd captured in a little baggy were most 
  definitely lint.

  She got told to stop scratching and put some cream on it, and she got a nice 
  friendly psych consult.

  Never, ever underestimate how many crazies there are. Just ask anyone in 
  retail or another customer-facing industry if you don't believe me.

    I've known people with this "disease" for almost 20 years. You know what 
    else these people had in common? They were all speed freaks, crystal meth 
    addicts. These people need a visit to the rehab (or puzzle palace, if 
    they're not on drugs), not the dermatologist.

    It's also in the opening chapter of A Scanner Darkly, by Philip K. Dick.


      Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor told him 
      there were no bugs in his hair. After he had taken a shower for eight 
      hours, standing under hot water hour after hour suffering the pain of the 
      bugs, he got out and dried himself, and he still had bugs in his hair; in 
      fact, he had bugs all over him. A month later he had bugs in his lungs.

      Having nothing else to do or think about, he began to work out 
      theoretically the life cycle of the bugs, and, with the aid of the 
      _Britannica_, try to determine specifically which bugs they were. They now 
      filled his house. He read about many different kinds and finally noticed 
      bugs outdoors, so he concluded they were aphids. After that decision came 
      to his mind it never changed, no matter what other people told him . . . 
      like "Aphids don't bite people."

      They said that to him because the endless biting of the bugs kept him in 
      torment. At the 7-11 grocery store, part of a chain spread out over most 
      of California, he bought spray cans of Raid and Black Flag and Yard Guard. 
      First he sprayed the house, then himself. The Yard Guard seemed to work 
      the best.

      As to the theoretical side, he perceived three stages in the cycle of the 
      bugs. First, they were carried to him to contaminate him by what he called 
      Carrier-people, which were people who didn't understand their role in 
      distributing the bugs. During that stage the bugs had no jaws or mandibles 
      (he learned that word during his weeks of scholarly research, an unusually 
      bookish occupation for a guy who worked at the Handy Brake and Tire place 
      relining people's brake drums). The Carrier-people therefore felt nothing. 
      He used to sit in the far corner of his living room watching different 
      Carrier-people enter--most of them people he'd known for a while, but some 
      new to him--covered with the aphids in this particular nonbiting stage. 
      He'd sort of smile to himself, because he knew that the person was being 
      used by the bugs and wasn't hip to it.

      "What are you grinning about, Jerry?" they'd say.

      He'd just smile.

      In the next stage the bugs grew wings or something, but they really 
      weren't precisely wings; anyhow, they were appendages of a functional sort 
      permitting them to swarm, which was how they migrated and 
      spread--especially to him. At that point the air was full of them; it made 
      his living room, his whole house, cloudy. During this stage he tried not 
      to inhale them.

      Most of all he felt sorry for his dog, because he could see the bugs 
      landing on and settling all over him, and probably getting into the dog's 
      lungs, as they were in his own. Probably--at least so his empathic ability 
      told him--the dog was suffering as much as he was. Should he give the dog 
      away for the dog's own comfort? No, he decided: the dog was now, 
      inadvertently, infected, and would carry the bugs with him everywhere.

      Sometimes he stood in the shower with the dog, trying to wash the dog 
      clean too. He had no more success with him than he did with himself. It 
      hurt to feel the dog suffer; he never stopped trying to help him. In some 
      respect this was the worst part, the suffering of the animal, who could 
      not complain.

      "What the fuck are you doing there all day in the shower with the goddamn 
      dog?" his buddy Charles Freck asked one time, coming in during this.

      Jerry said, "I got to get the aphids off him." He brought Max, the dog,

              I've noticed that at least one of the supposed links are dead. As 
              for how they got the media to buy in ...

              The wikipedia article was created in Feb of 2005. It contained a 
              one-sentence summary and a link to the website. The website is 
              registered by a dns proxy company, so there's no DNS contact 
              information. Ooh, another bizarre coincidence - the supposed 
              "national news broadcast" has been postponed until "june or july"; 
              release date of the movie is July 7th. When looking at it in a 
              paranoid mindset, lots of things on the site are curious. 
              Including the DISTINCT lack of decent contact information. I've 
              found only a few email addresses so far. Ironically, the only 
              person whose domain I've been able to nail down as non-anonymous 
              is the supposed webmaster. And his site is cheesily amusing in its 
              own right. :)

              The Scanner Darkly had its recent release date, September 16th, 
              pushed back to some time in March, 2006." [canmag.com] - as you 
              can see, it's been bumped around a fair amount.

  More like tinfoil-hat bullshit. Sorry folks, but Morgellons is a particularly 
  sad expression of schizophrenia, not a strange space-age malady that makes you 
  break out in deep-pile shag.
  It's particularly telling that the 'big' sites that 'cover' this 'malady' 
  don't actually show pictures of symptomatic sufferers or anything noteworthy 
  like that. No, instead we get useless SEM photos of fibres, bits of dust and 
  ECU shots of cat scratches.

      What if there are other undiscovered disease agents? It's immensely 
      hubristic to assume modern medicine has everything figured out yet. 
      This is the classic 'argument from ignorance'. To a some degree, you are 
      correct- Lack of evidence is not the same as evidence of lack. However, 
      this is only an argument of the possibility of something existing, not 
      that something does actually exist. That's a pretty weak argument. It can 
      be equally applied to almost any claim. Heck, it can be applied to Santa 
      Claus existing.
      just look at the battles the homeopathic community has to fight; some of 
      them are wackos perhaps, but many of them have treatments superior to 
      those of "modern" medicine. 
      Ah, now here you make a definitive argument: Homeopathic medicine is 
      effective. However, you don't back it up with any evidence at all (and 
      you've infected it with the old 'modern' medicine is ridgid strawman).
      To anyone who thinks Morgellon's must necessarily be a load of nonsense 
      You've got it backwards. People aren't saying it "must necessarily" be 
      nonsense. They're saying the evidence is weak, so it's not necessarily 
      what the victims say it is. There are lots of possibilities about what is 
      going on, from it being exactly what the victims claim to it being nothing 
      at all, to a whole rainbow of things in between. So don't just accept it 
      so readily. That's really showing a pretty closed mind. (And this goes for 
      Homeopathy too, btw)

      Oh, but it's not hubristic to assume homeopathic medicine had everything 
      figured out 200 years ago? You don't need to know about bacteria and 
      viruses, you don't need to know the molecular structure of proteins at 
      all, you don't need to examine the evidence, you don't need to do any 
      tests. Just stating that "like cures like" is enough... Talk about hubris!

      If there are diseases for which we do not know the cure, the solution is 
      not to go back to ignorance and superstition. Perhaps we do not have *the* 
      cure for AIDS or the common cold or many types of cancer, but we do get 
      better treatment all the time. Four years ago I had appendicitis. I was 
      treated by laparoscopy, which was done through three small cuts in my 
      belly, about one centimeter each. I spent two days in the hospital and 
      have no visible scars today. How would a similar treatment be performed 
      fifty years ago? Instead of sending a small remotely controlled equipment 
      into the patient's body, the surgeon had to cut him up enough to get both 
      hands inside.

      There may be some very rare diseases that haven't caught the attention of 
      modern medicine yet, but the most likely explanation for most of the 
      patients that claim to have such a rare disease is a very common ailment: 
      hypochondria. When I read about this so-called "Morgellon's syndrome", the 
      symptoms seemed familiar, I have read about this before [biofact.com]. 
      Perhaps what's missing in modern medical training is teaching all GPs to 
      send patients who have undiagnosed diseases with symptoms like chronic 
      muscle pain, itching, skin rashes, unusual hair loss, difficulty in 
      concentration and memory loss, etc, to psychiatric treatment.

  This is referred to as "delusions of parasitosis".

  http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic939.htm [emedicine.com]

  The *sensation* they have is "real", not to sound like Morpheus: feels like 
  bugs in skin. The sensation goes away quickly when Pimozide is prescribed.

  It's not all that uncommon.

  It's very hard to convince patients that they need Pimozide, and not a can of 
  "Raid" to spray on themselves.

  There's another web site that has been around longer relating to the same 
  issue:

  http://www.skinparasites.com/ [skinparasites.com]

  They misinterpret lint, fibers, dust, and other debris as parasites; sort of a 
  variant of hearing voices/OCD/other disorders where sensations are spurious or 
  can't be correctly decoded.

      You are quite correct--best to get an EKG/watch for extrapyramidal side 
      effects, but, I have found that very low doses of Pimozide are effective, 
      on the order of 1 or 2 mg a day, not a full antipsychotic dose.

      Most difficult therapeutic maneuver is building trust--not at all easy to

    Yes, this is (IMO) one of the more bizarre aspects of psychosis - it's not 
    just the the people suffering from it *believe* in things that aren't true, 
    they actually experience some of them directly.

    Even the article makes it abundantly clear that an infection is not the 
    problem. The real story here is the stigma attached to anything relating to 
    mental health. That is not to say these people are not suffering. The 
    problem is they refuse the professional's opinion out of hand. These people 
    are so frightened of being considered "delusional" that they act in ways 
    that make the rest of us think they are nuts:

    When Miles Lawrence sped to the hospital, he was told he had delusional 
    parasitosis and that the weird spines were "just dirt." But over the next 
    week his symptoms got worse. He scratched at his elbows and noticed more 
    fibers, and little black specks. "It was like they were fighting back," he 
    says.

    It is more important to Lawrence to insist he is not delusion (or perhaps 
    there are some other incentives, such as being special enough to be written 
    into a Popular Mechanics article, or the attention one receives when one has 
    a scary-sounding disease such as "Morgellons Syndrome") than to end his 
    suffering through several apparently effective cures. Those that allow 
    treatment see the alleviation of symptoms within weeks!

    The healthcare professionals (Doctors/etc) should really not be turning 
    these people away quite so easily imho.

    It's very difficult to properly treat someone who is delusional. In most of 
    the US, patients cannot be forced into treatment unless they are actively 
    suicidal or homicidal. In my experience, it's not that doctors turn them 
    away, it's that they refuse to accept what's really going on and leave on 
    their own.

  This isn't surprising at all. As someone who has been misdiagnosed with 
  schizophrenia with affective symptoms(schizoaffective disorder) because I 
  brought myself into the emergency room with tachycardia, panic, and what 
  appeared to me to be some kind of neurodegenerative illness(I literally could 
  not think), I doubt that the patients in this story are making up what they 
  feel. They certainly must feel the sensation of itching, scratching - it is 
  just as real to them as the breakfast they eat. In my case, it was 
  neurological Lyme disease, which the doctors in question failed to test for 
  and failed to diagnose, prescribing an antipsychotic medication - claiming I 
  was delusional - which made my symptoms much, much worse. However, after 
  seeking out the help of a psychiatrist and neurologist, I was offered correct 
  treatment for the Lyme disease that I was originally diagnosed for in 1989 - 
  when I was six years old - and for which I had been treated inadequately. 
  After intravenous treatment with antibiotics and immune-modulating drugs, my 
  brain became sharp again - indeed, sharper than it has been since I was a 
  small child, before my brain had fully developed. Schizophrenia doesn't go 
  away with antibiotics, and usually neither does severe cognitive decline - 
  Lyme disease does.

  In this case, there's a suspicious connection reported on multiple web sites 
  about people with this disease being co-diagnosed with Lyme disease. While 
  this "Morgellons" parasite-disease may be a delusion, it probably has a 
  neurologic, organic cause, due to suddenness of onset and other factors. I 
  wouldn't be surprised if the cause turned out to be Lyme disease, which can 
  have a wide range of neuropsychiatric effects including delusions, 
  hallucinations, memory problems, suicidal and homicidal ideation, thought 
  disorder, and severe cognitive deficits . One quote from TFA is quite telling:

    Ginger Savely, a nurse practitioner in Austin, Texas, says she has treated 
    35 patients with symptoms. "Everyone tells the exact same story," she says. 
    "It's just so consistent." Savely prescribes her patients a course of 
    broad-spectrum antibiotics. "If I knew what I was dealing with," she says, 
    "it would be easier to treat." Yet, she says, her patients--including 
    Lawrence--improve within weeks.
  . The fact that it may respond to antibiotics may indicate some relation to a 
  bacterial illness, in particular Lyme. It's truly an insidious disease that 
  can go undetected and undiagnosed for many years while patients' lives 
  deteriorate - and no doctors are literate enough in the treatment of this 
  disease to treat it adequately.

  In any case, the medical establishment is often too quick to diagnose a 
  patient with a complaint it does not understand as a primary-onset psychiatric 
  disorder. By doing this, they cause a great deal of harm by delaying treatment 
  in the case that the disease is *not* a psychiatric disorder. In order for 
  medicine to be able to heal people, it needs to stop this trend and start 
  taking earnest, persistent reports of people's pain seriously - even if it is 
  delusional. If all of the possible organic causes have been researched and 
  exhausted, only then is it time to take out the prescription pad for 
  anti-psychotic or other psychiatric medication.

    I also have late stage lyme.

    I can fully attest that you can give many doctors more information about 
    what's happening than they can ever image getting from a patient, and still 
    have them tell you it's all in your head.

    To be blunt, if you've never been in this sort of situation before, you 
    don't have the slightest clue about what you're talking about.

    As for lyme disease specifically, it's very, very well known that the tests 
    for it are horribly inaccurate. Even worse, if you do get a positive result, 
    the doctor probably doesn't have a clue about antibiotic treatment of a 
    neurological condition and making sure that the abx can get past the 
    blood-brain barrier. (ie, your chance for a correct diagnosis is slim, and 
    your chance for correct treatment is even slimmer.)

  The last link has a lot of pictures, and I feel sorry for that person if it is 
  true, but it is strange that the actual skin lesions these fiber clusters came 
  from are never shown, only the "stuff" that was supposedly pulled out of them. 
  But the "Treatment Recommendations" on p. 5 [morgellonsusa.com] certainly 
  sounds like a testimonial/marketing brochure for "Taurox". 
  Taurox has been evaluated by homeopathic experts and is registered with the 
  FDA. 
  Homeopathic experts?!? 
  Call Sharon now and use the following Code Number and because we are people 
  "greatly in need," you get an additional 15% discount off of the price. 
  Right, and who gets a cut from this "Code Number"? Note that the person was 
  already "80% better" (from standard antibiotic treatments) before the miracle 
  of Taurox entered the picture, apparently providing that last 20% boost for 
  the "fatigue" that remained after the mainstream treatment. 
  And the very odd thing is that the Morgellons Research Foundation site has no 
  mention of Taurox at all.
