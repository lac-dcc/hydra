However, logical reasoning about the control flow suggests that bb2 (loop header) and bb14 (loop body) are likely the hottest due to their role in the loop structure.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Critical edge blocks (bb2.bb12_crit_edge, bb3.bb12_crit_edge) were introduced during optimization.\n    - The loop structure in the original function maps directly to bb2 and bb14 in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
