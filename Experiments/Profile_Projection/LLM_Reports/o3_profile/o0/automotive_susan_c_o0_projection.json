This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, so the hotness ranking is based on structural analysis and the likelihood of execution paths.\n  - **Block Changes**: No blocks were explicitly split, merged, or removed in the optimized function. However, some blocks were reordered or renamed.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 18. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

All 69 blocks were accounted for.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 69."

Thus, the optimized blocks also inherit a frequency of 0.\n    - However, based on the structure of the function, bb4 is the entry point to the main loop and is likely the hottest block.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The original function's loop blocks (bb10, bb35) were merged and simplified into the optimized function's loop structure (bb4, bb9, bb11, bb40, bb55).\n    - Exit blocks (bb51, bb51.loopexit, etc.) were consolidated into bb56.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping was done by correlating the basic block counts and edge counts from the -O3 profile to the optimized function. Blocks with high execution counts in the -O3 profile were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived from the -O3 profile. For example, bb544 in the -O3 profile corresponds to the hottest block in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function may represent merged or split versions of blocks in the -O3 profile. However, the overall execution frequency was preserved during the mapping process.\n\n---\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57."
