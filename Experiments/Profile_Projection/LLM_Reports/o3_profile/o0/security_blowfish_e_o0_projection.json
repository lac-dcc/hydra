The loop (bb81, bb84, bb86, bb124) is likely the hottest region due to repeated iterations.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The loop body in the original function (52, 62, 80) is split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (bb81, bb84, bb86, bb124).\n    - Cleanup and exit blocks (94, 96, 111) are reorganized into bb137, bb139, and bb174.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10.
