    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping between the -O3 and -O0 versions was based on the structure of the control flow graph and the semantics of the blocks. For example, bb119 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in the original function that processes a large number of iterations, making it the hottest block.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the -O3 profile data onto the optimized function. For example, bb119 and bb119_119.ce were identified as the hottest blocks due to their high execution counts (17,820,594 and 17,820,495, respectively).\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function correspond to multiple blocks in the original function due to optimizations. For instance, bb119 includes the loop body from the original function, and bb124 corresponds to the encryption logic.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 62 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
