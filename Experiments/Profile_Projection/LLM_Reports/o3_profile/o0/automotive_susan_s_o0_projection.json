For example, bb153 in -O3 corresponds to bb153 in -O0, and its frequency was directly taken as 1389150000.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the -O3 version were split into multiple blocks in the -O0 version (e.g., bb122 and bb145 in -O3 correspond to bb122, bb129, and bb145 in -O0). These were handled by distributing the frequency proportionally.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 55 blocks."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete. However, we can infer relative hotness based on the control flow structure and the likelihood of execution paths.\n\n  - **Block Analysis**:\n    - bb4 is the entry point to the main loop and is executed for every iteration, making it the hottest block.\n    - bb9 is the first decision point within the loop, executed after bb4.\n    - bb11 and bb40 are the main body of the loop, executed depending on the condition in bb9.\n    - bb55 is the loop increment and continuation block, executed at the end of each iteration.\n    - bb is the function entry block, executed once.\n    - bb56 is the function exit block, executed once.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping between the -O3 and -O0 versions was based on control flow structure and the profile data. Blocks with high execution counts in the -O3 profile (e.g., 91) were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the -O0 version.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived from the -O3 profile data. For example, bb91 corresponds to the hottest block in the -O3 profile with a count of 25137.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging was observed that would affect the mapping.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
