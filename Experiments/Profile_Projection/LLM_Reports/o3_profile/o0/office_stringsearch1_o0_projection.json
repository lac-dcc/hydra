However, the structure of the loops suggests that bb1 (the entry to the first loop) is the hottest block, as it governs the initialization and iteration of the first loop.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The original bb8 loop was split into bb1, bb3, and bb6 in the optimized function.\n    - The original bb19 loop was split into bb9, bb12, and bb20 in the optimized function.\n    - The original bb48 was simplified into bb22.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."

For example, bb43 corresponds to the hottest loop in the -O3 version, with a high execution count.\n  - **Block Splits/Merges**: Some blocks in the -O3 version were split or merged in the -O0 version. For instance, bb43 in -O0 corresponds to a loop in -O3 that includes multiple blocks like bb32, bb39, and bb44.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 56 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
