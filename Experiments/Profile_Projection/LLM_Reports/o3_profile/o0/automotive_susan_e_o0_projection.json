However, some blocks in the optimized function may correspond to merged or split blocks in the original function.\n  - The basic block profile and edge profile from the original function indicate that all blocks have a count of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - Since all blocks have the same frequency (0), the hotness ranking is based on the order of appearance in the optimized function.\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **55**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

Blocks in loops and those with frequent branching conditions were considered hotter.\n  - **Block Changes**: No blocks were explicitly removed, but some blocks were split or merged during optimization. For example, bb8 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop header in the original function.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 18.

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O3 profile to the optimized function was based on structural analysis of the control flow graph and the correspondence of operations between the two versions. For example, bb53 in the optimized function corresponds to the hottest block in the -O3 profile (10), as it contains the main loop body.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the -O3 profile data onto the optimized function's structure. This involved summing the execution counts of corresponding blocks and edges.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the -O3 version were split into multiple blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb53 and its successors). These were aggregated for hotness estimation.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 138 blocks, as required."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, so we assume uniform execution probabilities for the loops and branches.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function has fewer blocks due to simplifications. For example, the critical edges and preheaders in the original function were merged into fewer blocks in the optimized version.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O3 profile to the optimized function was based on structural similarity and control flow. For example, bb36 corresponds to the hottest loop in the -O3 profile, as evidenced by the high counts in blocks like 346 and 362.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the execution counts from the -O3 profile. Blocks with high counts in the -O3 profile were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function correspond to multiple blocks in the -O3 profile due to splitting or merging during optimization. These were handled by summing the counts of the corresponding blocks.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
