    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping was done by analyzing the control flow and structure of the original and optimized functions. Blocks with similar functionality and control flow were matched.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived from the -O3 profile data. For example, bb51 corresponds to the hottest block in the -O3 profile (51), with a frequency of 4999900.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function correspond to multiple blocks in the original function due to transformations like inlining or loop unrolling. These were carefully analyzed to ensure accurate mapping.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 28 blocks. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
