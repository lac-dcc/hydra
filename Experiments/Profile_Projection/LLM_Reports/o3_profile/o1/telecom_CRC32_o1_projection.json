The structure remains consistent with the original.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - The loop in bb5 and bb9 is the most likely candidate for the hottest blocks due to the iterative processing of file data.\n    - bb5.preheader is executed once before entering the loop.\n    - Error handling blocks (bb19, bb19.bb23_crit_edge, bb22, bb23) are less likely to execute unless an error occurs.\n    - bb4 handles the case where the file cannot be opened, and bb26 is the final return block, both of which are executed minimally.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10.
