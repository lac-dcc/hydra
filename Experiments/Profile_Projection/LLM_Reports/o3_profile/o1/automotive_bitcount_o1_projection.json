    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The structure of the optimized function closely mirrors the original function, with no significant block merging or splitting. The basic blocks in the optimized function retain their original structure and purpose.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: Since all basic block counts and edge counts are 0 in the provided profiles, the hotness estimation relies on the logical structure of the function. Blocks within loops (e.g., bb4, bb14) are likely to be executed more frequently than others.\n  - **Block Analysis**:\n    - bb4 is the main loop body and is expected to be the hottest block.\n    - bb14 is part of the loop and is also likely to be executed frequently.\n    - bb4.preheader initializes the loop, so it is executed once per loop entry.\n    - bb14.bb4_crit_edge handles loop continuation, making it moderately hot.\n    - Exit blocks like bb22.loopexit and bb22 are executed less frequently.\n    - Entry blocks like bb and bb.bb22_crit_edge are executed only once, making them the least hot.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
