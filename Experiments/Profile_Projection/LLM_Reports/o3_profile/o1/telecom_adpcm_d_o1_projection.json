For example, bb in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the original function. Similarly, bb13 in the optimized function corresponds to the main computation block in the original function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: Since all basic block counts and edge counts in the -O3 profile are 0, the frequency of all blocks in the optimized function is also 0. However, the relative hotness ranking is based on the control flow structure and the likelihood of execution paths.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging was observed between the -O3 and -O1 versions. The structure of the control flow graph remains largely intact.\n  - **Summary Line**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."
