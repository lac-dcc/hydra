    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping was done by correlating the basic block counts and edge counts from the -O3 profile to the optimized function. Blocks with similar structure and execution paths were matched.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block was derived from the edge profile and basic block counts.\n  - **Splits/Merges**: Some blocks were split or merged during optimization, but their execution frequencies were distributed accordingly.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 87 blocks, as required."
