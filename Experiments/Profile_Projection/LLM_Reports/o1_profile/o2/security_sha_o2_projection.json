However, the profiling data does not provide any execution counts to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the O1 profile, the ranking is based on the logical flow of the function. The entry block (bb) is the most likely to execute, followed by blocks directly connected to it (bb.bb90_crit_edge, bb17).
