This means no profiling data was collected during execution, so all blocks are assumed to have equal execution likelihood.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging was observed that would affect the hotness ranking.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 51 blocks.\n\n**Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 51."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The mapping between the -O1 and -O2 versions is straightforward for most blocks, as the structure of the control flow graph is largely preserved. For example, bb121 in -O1 corresponds directly to bb121 in -O2, and so on.\n    - Some blocks in -O1, such as 13_17.ce and 13_21.ce, are represented as bb13.bb17_crit_edge and bb13.bb21_crit_edge in -O2.\n    - Blocks like bb93.preheader and bb119.preheader are loop preheaders introduced during optimization.\n\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in -O1 is directly taken from the basic block profile. For example, bb121 has a frequency of 17,820,594, making it the hottest block.\n\n  - **Splits, Merges, and Removals**:\n    - No blocks were removed, but some blocks were split into critical edges (e.g., bb13.bb17_crit_edge and bb13.bb21_crit_edge).\n    - Loop preheaders (e.g., bb93.preheader) were introduced during optimization.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **51**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The structure of the optimized function closely mirrors the original function, with some renaming and minor restructuring. For example:\n      - bb52 in the optimized function corresponds to 52 in the original function.\n      - bb80 corresponds to the loop body in 78.\n      - bb62 corresponds to 60.\n      - bb96 corresponds to 95.\n      - bb111 corresponds to 112.\n    - Blocks like bb52.preheader, bb52.bb80_crit_edge, and bb80.bb52_crit_edge are loop-related blocks introduced during optimization.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic block counts in the O1 profile are 0. This means no runtime execution data is available, so the analysis relies on static structure and control flow.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - No significant merging or splitting of blocks is observed. The optimized function retains the original structure with additional loop-related blocks.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - bb52 is the loop header and is likely the hottest block due to its role in controlling the loop.\n    - bb80 is the loop body and is the second hottest block.\n    - bb62 is the block where BF_encrypt is called, making it important but less frequent than the loop body.\n    - bb96 and bb94 handle post-loop operations, making them less hot than the loop.\n    - bb111 is the final block, executed once at the end.\n    - Preheader and critical edge blocks (bb52.preheader, bb52.bb80_crit_edge, bb80.bb52_crit_edge) are less frequently executed than the main blocks.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
