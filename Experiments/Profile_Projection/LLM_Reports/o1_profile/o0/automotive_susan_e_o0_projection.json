This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, the structure of the function suggests that bb4 (the loop header) is the hottest block because it controls the loop and is revisited for each iteration.\n    - bb9 is the next hottest block as it determines the path taken within the loop.\n    - bb11 and bb40 follow, as they represent the two branches of the conditional inside the loop.\n    - bb55 is the loop continuation block, executed at the end of each iteration.\n    - bb is the entry block, executed once.\n    - bb56 is the loop exit block, executed once when the loop terminates.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the original function to the optimized function was based on control flow and the structure of the IR. Blocks with high execution counts in the original profile (e.g., 196, 212, 220) were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the original function was used to estimate the hotness of blocks in the optimized function. For example, bb36 corresponds to the hottest path in the original profile.\n  - **Splits/Merges**: Some blocks in the optimized function were split or merged compared to the original function. This was accounted for by analyzing the control flow and edge profiles.\n  - **Block Count Confirmation**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
