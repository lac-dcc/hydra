This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, so we must rely on static analysis of the control flow.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function merges some blocks and simplifies the control flow. For example, the loop structure is more compact, and redundant blocks are removed.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - bb4 is the loop header and is likely the hottest block because it controls the loop iterations.\n    - bb9, bb11, and bb40 are part of the loop body and are executed within the loop.\n    - bb55 is the loop latch, executed at the end of each iteration.\n    - bb is the entry block, executed once.\n    - bb56 is the exit block, executed once after the loop terminates.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping was based on the structure of the control flow graph and the semantics of the blocks. For example, bb245 in the optimized function corresponds to the hottest block in the -O1 profile (block 245), which had the highest execution count (401,166).\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O1 profile was used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized function. Blocks with zero execution counts in the -O1 profile were ranked lower.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function were split or merged compared to the -O1 version. For example, bb245 and bb245_245.ce represent the same hot region in the -O1 profile but are split in the optimized function.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: The sorted list contains exactly 57 blocks, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
