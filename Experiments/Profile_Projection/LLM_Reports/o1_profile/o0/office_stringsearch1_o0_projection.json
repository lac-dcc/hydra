    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's bb3 corresponds to the loop initializing the @table array, which maps to bb1, bb3, and bb6 in the optimized function.\n    - The original function's bb8 corresponds to the loop processing the input string, which maps to bb9, bb12, and bb20 in the optimized function.\n    - The original function's bb18 corresponds to the final block storing @findme, which maps to bb22 in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic block counts and edge counts in the O1 profile are 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function splits the initialization loop (bb3 in O1) into bb1, bb3, and bb6.\n    - The string processing loop (bb8 in O1) is split into bb9, bb12, and bb20.\n    - The final block (bb18 in O1) is simplified to bb22.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - Despite the lack of profiling data, the string processing loop (bb9, bb12, bb20) is likely the hottest region because it iterates over the input string. Among these, bb9 is the entry point and dominates the loop, making it the hottest block.\n    - Initialization blocks (bb1, bb3, bb6) are less frequently executed as they iterate over a fixed range (256).\n    - bb22 is executed once at the end, making it the least hot block.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling or that the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging is evident between the -O1 and optimized versions. The CFG structure is largely preserved, with some additional critical edge blocks introduced in the optimized version.\n  - **Hotness Ranking**: Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the -O1 profile, the hotness ranking is based on the natural execution order of the blocks in the optimized CFG, starting from the entry block (bb) and following the control flow.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 17."
