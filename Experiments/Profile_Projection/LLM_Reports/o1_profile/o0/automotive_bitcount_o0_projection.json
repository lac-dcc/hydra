    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The original function's basic blocks (e.g., bb, bb11, bb20, etc.) were mapped to the optimized function's blocks based on their logical roles and control flow. For example, bb in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the original function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the original function have a frequency of 0 based on the provided profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: The optimized function has undergone transformations such as block merging and splitting. For instance, bb23 in the optimized function corresponds to parts of the loop in the original function.\n  - **Hotness Assumptions**: Since all profile counts are 0, the hotness ranking is based on the control flow structure and logical execution order in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's blocks (e.g., bb, bb1, bb4, etc.) were transformed into the optimized function's blocks (bb, bb2, bb3, etc.).\n    - The loop structure in the original function (e.g., bb4, bb14) corresponds to the loop in the optimized function (bb2, bb14).\n    - Critical edges in the original function (e.g., bb1.bb22_crit_edge, bb4.bb22.loopexit_crit_edge) are represented as separate blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb2.bb12_crit_edge, bb3.bb12_crit_edge).\n\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic block counts and edge counts in the O1 profile are 0. This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into smaller blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb1 split into bb2 and bb3).\n    - Critical edges in the original function were explicitly represented as blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb2.bb12_crit_edge, bb3.bb12_crit_edge).\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Without execution counts, the ranking is based on structural analysis. Entry blocks (bb, bb2) are likely hotter as they are traversed first. Loop-related blocks (bb14) are ranked higher due to potential iteration. Critical edge blocks (bb2.bb12_crit_edge, bb3.bb12_crit_edge) are ranked lower as they are less likely to dominate execution.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
