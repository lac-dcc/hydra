For example, bb91 in the optimized function corresponds to the hottest block in the original profile with a count of 25,137.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the original function was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function were split or merged, but the overall control flow structure was preserved. For example, bb91 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in the original function with the highest execution count.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 57 blocks, as required."
