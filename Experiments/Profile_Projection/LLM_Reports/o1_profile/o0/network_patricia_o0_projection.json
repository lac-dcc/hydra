    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: \n    - The hottest block in the original function (36) corresponds to the loop in the optimized function, which is primarily represented by bb47 and its successors (bb51, bb54, etc.).\n    - Blocks like bb6, bb10, and bb15 correspond to early exits in the function, which are less frequently executed.\n    - Blocks bb122 and bb123 correspond to the loop exit and function return, respectively.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - freq(36) = 5,050,000 (hottest block in O1).\n    - freq(39) = 5,000,000.\n    - freq(44) = 5,000,000.\n    - freq(49) = 5,000,000.\n    - freq(54) = 5,000,000.\n    - freq(68) = 4,999,984.\n    - Other blocks have significantly lower frequencies.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The loop in 36 was split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (bb47, bb51, bb54, etc.).\n    - Some blocks in the original function (e.g., 14, 20, 25, 30, 43, etc.) were optimized out or merged into other blocks.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 28. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
