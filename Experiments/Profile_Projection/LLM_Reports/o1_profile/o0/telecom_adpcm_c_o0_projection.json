This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: The optimized function splits some blocks (e.g., bb13 into bb39 and bb39.bb49_crit_edge) and introduces new blocks for better control flow handling. However, no blocks are entirely removed.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**: Since all blocks in the O1 profile have a frequency of 0, the \"hottest\" block in the optimized function is chosen based on its role in the function. bb93 is the final block that stores the results and returns, making it critical for function completion.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 32."
