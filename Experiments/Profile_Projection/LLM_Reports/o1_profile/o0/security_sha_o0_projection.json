This block is executed most frequently due to the high iteration count.\n    - Blocks like bb100, bb121, and bb145 correspond to subsequent SHA rounds, which are also executed frequently but slightly less than bb77.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - Using the basic block and edge profiles, the frequency of execution for each block in the -O1 IR was calculated.

Thus, it is the hottest block.\n    - bb is the entry block and is executed once per function call, making it the second hottest.\n    - bb22 and bb13 are mutually exclusive, and their hotness depends on the condition %i12.
