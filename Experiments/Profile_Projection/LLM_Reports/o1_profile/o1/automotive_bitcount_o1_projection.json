    "additionalNotes": "- The profile data for the original function shows all basic block counts and edge counts as 0. This indicates that the function was either not executed during profiling or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - Since all counts are 0, there is no meaningful way to differentiate the hotness of the blocks based on execution frequency. Therefore, the blocks are listed in their natural order as they appear in the optimized function.\n  - No blocks were split, merged, or removed during optimization. The mapping between the original and optimized blocks is straightforward.\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
