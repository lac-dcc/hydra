    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The hottest block in the original profile, 33, corresponds to bb33 in the optimized function. Its loop-carried edge 33 -> 33_33.ce maps to bb33.bb33_crit_edge.\n    - Blocks like 46 and 46_30.ce in the original profile map to bb46 and bb46.bb30_crit_edge in the optimized function.\n    - Blocks 88 and 88_88.ce in the original profile map to bb88 and bb88.bb88_crit_edge in the optimized function.\n    - Cold blocks like 67, 70, and 83 remain cold in the optimized function.\n\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - bb33: 156,894,928\n    - bb33.bb33_crit_edge: 137,283,062\n    - bb46: 19,611,866\n    - bb46.bb30_crit_edge: 19,290,360\n    - bb30: 19,611,866\n    - bb88.bb88_crit_edge: 2,250,542\n    - bb88: 2,572,048\n    - Remaining blocks have frequencies derived from their original counterparts.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks were split (e.g., 33 into bb33 and bb33.bb33_crit_edge).\n    - Some blocks were merged or optimized away, but all 25 blocks in the optimized function are accounted for.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25."
