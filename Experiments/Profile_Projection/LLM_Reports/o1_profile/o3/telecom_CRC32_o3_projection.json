This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was incomplete.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function introduces additional blocks (e.g., bb31.bb45_crit_edge, bb7.bb7_crit_edge) due to loop unrolling and other optimizations. These blocks are derived from the original loop structure.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Since all blocks in the O1 profile have a frequency of 0, the hotness ranking is based on the control flow structure and the likelihood of execution paths.\n    - Entry blocks (bb, bb.bb48_crit_edge) are ranked higher as they are always executed.\n    - Loop-related blocks (bb2, bb7, etc.) are ranked lower due to the absence of profiling data indicating loop iterations.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
