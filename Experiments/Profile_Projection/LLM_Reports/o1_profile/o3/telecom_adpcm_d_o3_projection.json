Blocks like bb, bb7, bb13, etc., correspond directly between the two versions.\n    - Blocks such as bb.bb84_crit_edge and bb78.bb84_crit_edge are critical edges introduced during optimization.\n  - Since all counts are 0, the hotness ranking is arbitrary. I have listed the blocks in the order they appear in the optimized function.\n  - Computed freq(bb) table for -O1:\n    text\n    bb: 0\n    bb.bb84_crit_edge: 0\n    bb7: 0\n    bb13: 0\n    bb65: 0\n    bb68: 0\n    bb72: 0\n    bb72.bb13_crit_edge: 0\n    bb78: 0\n    bb78.bb84_crit_edge: 0\n    bb82: 0\n    bb84: 0\n    \n  - No blocks were split, merged, or removed during optimization.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
