The block names in the optimized function correspond directly to those in the original function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: All basic block counts in the O1 profile are 0. This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, so we cannot derive any runtime hotness information from the profile data.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**: Since the profile data is entirely 0, the ranking is based on the control flow structure. The entry block (bb) is the starting point and is always executed, making it the \"hottest\" by default. Other blocks are ranked based on their position in the control flow graph, with earlier blocks being more likely to execute than later ones.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
