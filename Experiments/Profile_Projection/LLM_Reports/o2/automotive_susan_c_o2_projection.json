    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping from the -O0 profile to the optimized function was based on structural analysis of the control flow graph (CFG). The entry block bb is the starting point and is executed at least once, making it the hottest block.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, indicating no execution data was collected. This makes the projection speculative, relying on the CFG structure.\n  - **Block Transformations**: No blocks were explicitly split, merged, or removed in the optimized function. However, some blocks were renamed or restructured for optimization.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **56**, matching the expected count."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping was based on the control flow structure and the profile data. For example, bb11 in the optimized function corresponds to 36 in the -O0 profile, which has the highest execution count (1564).\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 profile was directly used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function are split versions of blocks in the -O0 function. For example, bb11 and bb11.preheader are derived from 36. Their hotness was combined for ranking.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 143 blocks, as required."
