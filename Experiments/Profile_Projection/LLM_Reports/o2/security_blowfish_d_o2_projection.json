This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected properly.\n  - **Block Transformations**:\n    - Some blocks were split or merged during optimization. For example, 81 in O0 corresponds to bb52.preheader and bb52 in O2.\n    - Critical edges like 84_124.ce and 137_174.ce were split into bb52.bb80_crit_edge and bb94.bb111_crit_edge, respectively.\n  - **Hotness Estimation**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, the structure of the function suggests that bb52 (the main loop header) is the hottest block, as it governs the primary loop.\n    - Blocks like bb80 and bb62 are also likely hot due to their positions within the loop.\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12.
