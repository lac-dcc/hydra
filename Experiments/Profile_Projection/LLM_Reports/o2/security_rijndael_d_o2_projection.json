However, the structure of the optimized function suggests that the control flow and basic blocks are preserved, with some blocks potentially split or merged.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No explicit evidence of block splitting or merging is provided in the profiles. The analysis assumes a one-to-one mapping where possible.\n  - **Sorting Rationale**: Since all blocks have a frequency of 0, the sorting is based on the order of appearance in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 33."
