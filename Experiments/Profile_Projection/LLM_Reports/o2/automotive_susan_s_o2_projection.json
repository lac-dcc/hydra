    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping between the -O0 and -O2 versions is straightforward for most blocks, as the structure of the control flow graph is preserved. However, some blocks in the optimized version are split or merged due to optimizations like loop unrolling and redundant block elimination.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, as indicated in the provided profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb15.bb31_crit_edge, bb31.bb15_crit_edge) are artifacts of loop optimizations and do not have direct counterparts in the -O0 version.\n  - **Assumptions**: Since all profile counts are zero, the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of blocks in the control flow graph, with entry blocks and loop headers prioritized.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 31."
