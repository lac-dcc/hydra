    "additionalNotes": "- Mapping was done by analyzing the control flow and edge profile from the -O0 version to the optimized version. Blocks like bb36 correspond to the loop body in the optimized function, which is executed most frequently based on the profile data.\n  - The freq(bb) table was computed by propagating the execution counts from the -O0 profile to the optimized blocks. For example, the loop in bb36 corresponds to the hottest path in the -O0 profile.\n  - Some blocks were split or merged during optimization. For instance, bb75 in the -O0 version maps to multiple blocks in the optimized version, including bb36 and bb70.\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
