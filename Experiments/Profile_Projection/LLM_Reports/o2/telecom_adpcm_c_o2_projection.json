This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the -O0 version were split or merged in the optimized version:\n    - bb13 in the optimized version combines parts of the loop from the original function.\n    - bb13.bb28_crit_edge and bb28.bb13_crit_edge represent critical edges introduced during optimization.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: The list contains exactly 10 blocks, as required."
