For example, critical edges in the original function were split into separate blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb72.bb13_crit_edge).\n    - The optimized function has fewer redundant blocks due to loop unrolling and branch simplifications.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
