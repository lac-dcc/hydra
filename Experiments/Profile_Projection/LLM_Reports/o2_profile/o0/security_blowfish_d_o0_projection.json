Blocks like bb119 and bb119_119.ce are the hottest due to their high loop iteration counts.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb53, bb53.bb59_crit_edge) represent split versions of blocks in the original function. These were handled by distributing the profile counts proportionally based on the control flow.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 62."

The loop blocks (bb81, bb84, bb86, bb124) are likely to be the hottest due to their placement in the loop.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The loop structure in the original function (52, 62, 80, etc.) has been optimized into a more compact form in the optimized function (bb81, bb84, bb86, bb124).\n    - Some blocks in the original function (e.g., 52_80.ce, 80_52.ce) are no longer explicitly present in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."
