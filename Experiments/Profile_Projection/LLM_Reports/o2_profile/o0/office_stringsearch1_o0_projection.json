This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, so we rely on structural analysis to estimate hotness.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The initialization loop (bb8 in the original) was split into bb1 and bb3 in the optimized function.\n    - The main processing loop (bb19 in the original) was split into bb9, bb12, and bb20 in the optimized function.\n    - The final block (bb48 in the original) maps directly to bb22.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
