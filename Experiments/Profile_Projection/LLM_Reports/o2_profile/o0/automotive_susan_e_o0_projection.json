This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n    - In the absence of execution data, the structure of the function suggests that bb4 is the loop header and will likely execute the most frequently, as it governs the loop iterations.\n    - Blocks bb9, bb11, and bb40 are part of the loop body and will execute less frequently than bb4 but more frequently than the non-loop blocks.\n    - bb55 is the loop exit block and will execute once per loop exit.\n    - bb is the entry block and executes once.\n    - bb56 is the return block and executes once.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - Since all counts are 0, the frequency table is based on structural analysis:\n      - bb4: Highest frequency (loop header).\n      - bb9, bb11, bb40: Medium frequency (loop body).\n      - bb55: Low frequency (loop exit).\n      - bb, bb56: Lowest frequency (entry and return).\n  - **Block Changes**:\n    - No blocks were removed, but some were merged or split during optimization.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the original function to the optimized function was based on control flow and the structure of the IR. Blocks with high execution counts in the original profile (e.g., 246, 274, 283) were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the execution counts from the original profile. For example, bb36 corresponds to the loop header in the optimized function, which is executed frequently due to the high counts in 246 and 262.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the original function were split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb45 and bb45.bb81_crit_edge), while others were merged. This was accounted for in the hotness estimation.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 57 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
