    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function at -O2 has a more complex structure with many basic blocks, while the optimized function at -O0 has been simplified into fewer blocks. The mapping is as follows:\n      - bb in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the original function.\n      - bb4 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop header and body in the original function (bb7 and its successors).\n      - bb5 corresponds to the loop body where the CRC computation occurs.\n      - bb14 corresponds to the loop backedge and continuation logic.\n      - bb17 corresponds to the final block where the result is returned.\n  - **Frequency Analysis**:\n    - The -O2 profile data shows all basic block counts and edge counts as 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete. However, based on the structure of the function:\n      - The loop (bb4, bb5, bb14) is likely the hottest region because it performs the main CRC computation.\n      - bb17 is executed once after the loop terminates.\n      - bb is the entry block and is executed once.\n  - **Computed freq(bb) Table**:\n    - bb: 1 (entry block)\n    - bb4: High (loop header, executed for each iteration)\n    - bb5: High (loop body, executed for each iteration)\n    - bb14: High (loop backedge, executed for each iteration)\n    - bb17: 1 (final block)\n  - **Block Simplifications**:\n    - The loop in the original function (bb7 and its successors) has been merged into a simpler structure in the optimized function (bb4, bb5, bb14).\n    - Unused blocks in the original function (e.g., bb2, bb31) have been removed.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 5."
