    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: \n    - The original function's structure was more complex, with critical edges and loop exit blocks. The optimized function simplifies this by merging some blocks and removing unnecessary control flow.\n    - For example, the original bb4 and bb14 correspond to the loop body in the optimized function (bb14), while bb22 in the original maps to the return block in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic block counts and edge counts in the profile are 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n    - Without execution data, the hotness estimation relies on structural analysis and the likelihood of execution paths.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Blocks like bb4 and bb14 in the original function are merged into bb14 in the optimized function.\n    - Critical edges (bb1.bb22_crit_edge, bb4.bb22.loopexit_crit_edge) are eliminated in the optimized version.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - bb2 is the entry point of the main loop and is likely to be executed frequently.\n    - bb initializes the loop, so it is executed at least once.\n    - bb3 and bb7 are part of the loop body, with bb7 being less likely to execute due to the conditional branch.\n    - bb12 and bb14 handle loop continuation and updates, making them moderately hot.\n    - bb22 is the return block, executed once.\n    - bb3.bb12_crit_edge and bb2.bb12_crit_edge are less likely to execute due to their placement in the control flow.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
