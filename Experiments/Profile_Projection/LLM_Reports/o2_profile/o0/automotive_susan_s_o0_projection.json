For example, bb152 in the original corresponds to the main loop in the optimized function, which is the hottest block.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the profile data from the original function. For example, bb152 in the original has a count of 1,389,150,000, which directly maps to the hottest loop in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the original function were split into smaller blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb152 corresponds to multiple blocks in the optimized version). However, the overall structure was preserved.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 55 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This makes the analysis speculative based on structural importance.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant splitting or merging was observed. Blocks in the optimized function correspond closely to those in the original function.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **77**, matching the expected count."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected properly.\n    - In the absence of execution data, the control flow structure of the optimized function suggests that bb4 is the entry point and the loop header, making it the most likely candidate for the hottest block.\n    - Blocks bb9, bb11, and bb40 are part of the loop body and are ranked next based on their position in the control flow.\n    - bb55 is the loop latch, and bb56 is the exit block, making them less frequently executed than the loop body.\n    - bb is the entry block but only serves as a transition to bb4, so it is the least hot.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - Since all counts are 0, the table remains empty, and the ranking is based on control flow analysis.\n  - **Block Changes**:\n    - No blocks were split, merged, or removed in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping was based on the control flow structure and the profile data. For example, bb91 in the optimized function corresponds to the hottest block in the original function with a count of 25,137.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block was derived from the basic block and edge profiles. Blocks with zero counts in the original profile were assigned low priority in the sorted list.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging was observed. The structure of the optimized function largely aligns with the original function.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
