This implies that the function was not executed during profiling, so all blocks are equally \"cold.\"\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant splitting or merging of blocks is observed between the original and optimized versions. The CFG structure remains consistent.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 38, matching the count of blocks in the optimized function.
