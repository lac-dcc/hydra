    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: \n    - The hottest block in the original function (bb36) corresponds to bb47 in the optimized function. This is because bb47 contains the loop header for the main processing loop, which is executed 5,050,000 times in the original profile.\n    - Blocks like bb39, bb44, and bb49 in the original function map to parts of the loop body in the optimized function, such as bb51, bb54, and bb64.\n    - Blocks with zero execution counts in the original profile (e.g., bb14, bb20, bb25, etc.) correspond to blocks like bb6, bb15, and bb22 in the optimized function, which are rarely or never executed.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by mapping the execution counts from the original function's profile to the corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb36 split into bb47, bb51, and bb54).\n    - Some blocks were merged or removed due to optimizations, resulting in fewer transitions in the optimized function.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 28 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
