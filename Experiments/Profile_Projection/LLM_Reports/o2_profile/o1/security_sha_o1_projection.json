    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The profile data from the -O2 version was mapped to the optimized version by analyzing the control flow and identifying corresponding blocks. For example, bb in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the original function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block was inferred based on the edge profile and the control flow structure. Blocks like bb and bb11 are executed frequently due to loops, while others like bb101 are executed less often.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function may have been split or merged during optimization, but all 25 blocks were accounted for in the sorted list.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25."
