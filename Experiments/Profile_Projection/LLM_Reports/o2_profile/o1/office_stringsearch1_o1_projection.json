    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O2 profile to the optimized -O1 profile was done by analyzing the control flow and matching the basic block structure. Blocks with similar functionality and execution paths were aligned.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived from the -O2 profile data, considering the edge counts and the control flow structure.\n  - **Splits/Merges**: Some blocks in the optimized function were split or merged compared to the original function. For example, bb32 and bb44 in the optimized function correspond to hot paths in the original function.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 87 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
