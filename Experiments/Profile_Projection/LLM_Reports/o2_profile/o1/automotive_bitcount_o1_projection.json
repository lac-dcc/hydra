    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The structure of the optimized function closely mirrors the original function, with no significant block merging or splitting. The basic blocks in the optimized function correspond directly to those in the original function.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: Since all basic block counts and edge counts are 0 in the provided profile, the hotness ranking is based on the structure of the function and the likelihood of execution paths. Blocks within loops (bb4, bb14) are assumed to be hotter due to their iterative nature.\n  - **Block Analysis**:\n    - bb4 is the loop body and is likely the hottest block.\n    - bb14 is part of the loop and is also frequently executed.\n    - bb4.preheader initializes the loop, so it is executed once per loop entry.\n    - bb14.bb4_crit_edge and bb22.loopexitsplit are part of the loop exit mechanism.\n    - bb22.loopexit and bb22 handle loop termination and function return.\n    - bb, bb1, and their critical edges (bb.bb22_crit_edge, bb1.bb22_crit_edge) are part of the function entry and null-check logic.\n    - bb4.bb22.loopexit_crit_edge is less frequently executed as it handles specific loop exit conditions.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
