Blocks like bb, bb7, and bb13 in the optimized version correspond directly to their counterparts in the original function. Some blocks were renamed or slightly modified, but their roles in the CFG are clear.\n  - **Computed O1 freq(bb) Table**: Since all basic block counts and edge counts in the -O2 profile are 0, the projected frequencies for the -O1 blocks are also 0. This means all blocks are equally \"cold\" in terms of execution frequency.\n  - **Block Changes**: No blocks were split, merged, or removed during optimization. The CFG structure remained consistent between the -O2 and -O1 versions.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."
