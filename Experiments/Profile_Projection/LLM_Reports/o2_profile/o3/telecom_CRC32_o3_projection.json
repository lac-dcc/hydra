However, bb9 is executed repeatedly within the loop, making it the most frequently visited block.\n    - bb5 is the second hottest block as it is the loop header and executed slightly more than bb9.\n    - bb and bb5.preheader are executed once per function invocation, making them less hot than the loop blocks.\n    - bb19, bb19.bb23_crit_edge, bb23, and bb26 are executed once per loop exit, making them cooler than the loop blocks.\n    - bb4 and bb22 are cold blocks, with bb22 being completely unused.\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."

The basic blocks in the optimized function correspond directly to those in the original function.\n  - Since all blocks have the same execution count (0), the \"hotness\" ranking is arbitrary. The entry block (bb) is listed first as it is the starting point of the function, followed by other blocks in a logical order based on the control flow.\n  - No blocks were split, merged, or removed during optimization.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."
