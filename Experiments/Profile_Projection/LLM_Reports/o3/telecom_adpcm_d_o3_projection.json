This suggests that the profiling data is either incomplete or the function was not executed during profiling.\n  - **Block Transformations**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split or merged in the optimized version. For example, bb72 and bb72.bb13_crit_edge likely represent iterations of a loop.\n    - Blocks like bb.bb84_crit_edge are critical edges introduced during optimization to simplify control flow.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **12**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
