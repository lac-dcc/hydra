This means no execution data is available, so the hotness ranking is based on structural importance and execution likelihood inferred from the control flow.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the -O0 version were split or merged in the optimized version:\n    - bb13 in the optimized function combines parts of the loop body from the original function.\n    - bb13.bb28_crit_edge and bb28.bb13_crit_edge represent critical edges introduced during optimization.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10.
