    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping between the -O0 and -O3 versions is straightforward for most blocks, as the structure of the control flow graph (CFG) is preserved. However, some blocks in the optimized version are split or merged due to optimizations like loop unrolling and dead code elimination.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, as indicated in the provided profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb15.bb31_crit_edge, bb31.bb15_crit_edge) are the result of splitting due to loop optimizations. These are treated as separate blocks in the hotness ranking.\n  - **Assumptions**: Since all profile counts are 0, the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of blocks in the CFG, with entry blocks and loop headers prioritized.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 31."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The bb block in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the original function.\n    - Blocks like bb10 and bb35 in the optimized function represent the loop bodies from the original function.\n    - Blocks such as bb51 and its variants (bb51.loopexit, bb51.loopexit1, etc.) represent the exit points of the loops.\n    - The bb6 block corresponds to the branch decision based on %arg3 in the original function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the original function have a frequency of 0 based on the provided profile data. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function has undergone significant transformations, including loop unrolling and preheader creation. For example, bb10.preheader and bb35.preheader are new blocks introduced for loop setup.\n    - Some blocks in the original function (e.g., bb55) have been split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb10, bb35, etc.).\n  - **Assumptions**:\n    - Since all profile counts are 0, the hotness ranking is based on structural analysis of the function. Entry blocks and loop-related blocks are prioritized as they are likely to execute more frequently in typical scenarios.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
