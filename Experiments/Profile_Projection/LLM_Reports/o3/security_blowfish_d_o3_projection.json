For example, bb119 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in bb157 and bb160 in the original function.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 51 blocks."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The loop structure in the original function (bb81, bb84, bb124) has been optimized into bb52, bb80, and related blocks.\n    - Cleanup and return blocks (bb137, bb174) have been optimized into bb94, bb96, and bb111.\n  - **Assumptions**:\n    - Since the profile data is all zeros, the hotness ranking is based on the structure of the function and the likelihood of execution paths.
