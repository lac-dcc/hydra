These frequencies were then mapped to the optimized function based on structural similarity and control flow.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Several blocks in the original function were merged into fewer blocks in the optimized function. For example, bb13 in the optimized function represents a combination of multiple hot blocks from the original function.\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function, like bb74, represent loop structures that aggregate multiple iterations of the original function's blocks.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13.
