    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: \n    - The hottest block in the original function (bb36) corresponds to the loop in the optimized function, which processes the input file line by line. This block is executed 5,000,000 times in the original profile, making it the hottest.\n    - Blocks like bb70 and bb75 are part of the same loop structure and inherit their hotness from the original loop.\n    - Blocks such as bb106, bb106_115.ce, and bb115 correspond to specific conditions and iterations within the loop, with their frequencies derived from the edge profile.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the original function was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb70.bb36_crit_edge) are split versions of the original loop structure. Their hotness is derived from the parent block (bb36).\n    - Blocks like bb73 and bb76 represent cleanup and exit paths, which are executed less frequently.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
