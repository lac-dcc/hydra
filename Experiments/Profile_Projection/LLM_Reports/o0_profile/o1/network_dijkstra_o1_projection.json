    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The hottest block in the original profile (82) corresponds to bb82 in the optimized function. This block contains the main loop where dijkstra is called, and its frequency is derived from the loop iterations (2500005).\n    - Blocks 85 and 86 in the original profile correspond to parts of the same loop in the optimized function, contributing to the hotness of bb85 and bb86.\n    - Blocks like 56, 59, and 68 in the original profile map to intermediate blocks in the loop, corresponding to bb56, bb59, and bb68 in the optimized function.\n    - Blocks 7 and 15 in the original profile are cold and correspond to bb15 and bb15.bb64_crit_edge in the optimized function.\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the original profile was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized function. For example, freq(bb82) = 2500005, freq(bb85) = 2500000, and so on.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb82 and bb85).\n    - Some blocks were merged or optimized away, resulting in fewer transitions in the optimized function.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 29."
