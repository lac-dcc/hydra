All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a count of 0, and all edges have a count of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All blocks in the -O0 version have a frequency of 0.\n  - **Block Transformations**: The optimized function appears to have undergone significant transformations, including block splitting and merging. However, due to the lack of execution data, it is impossible to determine the exact transformations or relative hotness of the blocks.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."

For example, 53 in -O0 corresponds to bb34 in -O1, as both represent the main loop body.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 profile was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in -O0 were split into multiple blocks in -O1 (e.g., 53 split into bb34 and related blocks). These were aggregated for hotness estimation.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 92 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This means no execution data is available, and the analysis assumes uniform distribution or relies on structural analysis.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Critical edge splitting introduces blocks like bb.bb28_crit_edge, which do not have direct counterparts in the -O0 version. These are treated as intermediate blocks with inferred frequencies.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **58**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's basic blocks (bb, bb4, bb9, bb11, bb40, bb55, bb56) were mapped to the optimized function's blocks based on their functionality and control flow. For example:\n      - bb in the original corresponds to bb in the optimized.\n      - bb4 corresponds to the loop structure in bb10 and bb38.\n      - bb9 corresponds to the branch in bb6.\n      - bb11 corresponds to bb15.\n      - bb40 corresponds to bb31.\n      - bb55 corresponds to the loop continuation in bb38.bb10_crit_edge.\n      - bb56 corresponds to the exit in bb44.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function has split some blocks (e.g., bb4 into bb10 and bb38) and merged others. The loop structure is more explicit in the optimized version.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the O0 profile, the hotness ranking is based on the control flow structure. The entry block (bb) is the hottest as it is always executed. Loop-related blocks (bb6, bb10, bb15, bb31, bb38) are ranked next, followed by less frequently executed blocks like bb.bb44_crit_edge, bb44.loopexit, and bb44.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
