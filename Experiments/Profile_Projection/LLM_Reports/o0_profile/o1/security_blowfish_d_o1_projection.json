For example, bb157 in the original function had a frequency of 17,820,693, which maps to bb97 in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the original function were split or merged in the optimized function. For instance, the loop in bb157 was optimized into bb97 with fewer intermediate blocks.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 51, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's structure at -O0 was more verbose, with redundant operations and intermediate steps. The optimized function at -O1 consolidates these into fewer, more efficient blocks.\n    - The bb52 block in the optimized function corresponds to the loop body in the original function, which includes blocks 81, 84, 86, and 124. This loop is the core of the encryption process and is expected to execute the most frequently.\n    - The bb78 block in the optimized function corresponds to the continuation of the loop, handling the iteration logic.\n    - Blocks like bb60 and bb95 handle specific operations within the loop or cleanup after the loop.\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the profiling data is incomplete or the function was not executed during profiling. However, we can still infer relative hotness based on the structure of the code and the role of each block.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function merges several blocks from the original function into fewer blocks. For example, the loop body (81, 84, 86, 124) is consolidated into bb52 and bb78.\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb.bb92_crit_edge, bb92.bb112_crit_edge) are introduced for better control flow management but do not correspond directly to any specific block in the original function.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
