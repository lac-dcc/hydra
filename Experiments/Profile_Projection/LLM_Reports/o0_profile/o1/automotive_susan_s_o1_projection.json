    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping between the -O0 and -O1 versions is straightforward for some blocks, but others involve transformations like splitting or merging. For example:\n    - bb in the optimized version corresponds to the entry block in the original function.\n    - Loops in the original function (e.g., bb73, bb76) are unrolled and optimized into blocks like bb47, bb53, and their critical edges.\n    - Blocks like bb107 in the original function correspond to bb67 in the optimized version, where the final computation and return occur.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This means no execution data is available, so the analysis assumes uniform execution likelihood across all blocks.\n  - **Block Transformations**:\n    - Some blocks were split (e.g., bb79 into bb53 and bb61).\n    - Critical edges were explicitly materialized (e.g., bb79_101.ce became bb53.bb62_crit_edge).\n    - Some blocks were merged or optimized away.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This means no execution data is available, and all blocks are equally \"cold.\"\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant splitting or merging is evident in the optimized version. The CFG structure remains largely intact.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**: Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the -O0 profile, the ranking is arbitrary.

This means no execution data is available for the -O0 version, so the hotness ranking is based on structural analysis and the likelihood of execution paths.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Critical edge splitting introduces blocks like bb.bb28_crit_edge, bb40.bb115_crit_edge, etc. These are artifacts of optimization and are ranked based on their parent blocks' likelihood of execution.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **58**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function has split some blocks (e.g., bb38.bb10_crit_edge and bb.bb44_crit_edge) for better control flow and optimization.\n    - Some blocks from the original function (e.g., bb55) have been merged into others in the optimized version.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the original profile, the ranking is based on the logical execution flow of the function. The entry block (bb) is the hottest as it is always executed. Blocks like bb6, bb10, and bb15 are ranked higher due to their position in the control flow and likelihood of execution in a typical run.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."

Blocks with high execution counts in the -O0 profile (e.g., 36, 38, 91) were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 profile was directly used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version were split or merged, but the overall control flow structure remained consistent, allowing for a direct mapping.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 109 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
