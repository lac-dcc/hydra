    "additionalNotes": "- The basic block profile and edge profile for the -O0 version indicate that all blocks have a count of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - Without execution data, all blocks are equally likely to be executed. However, the entry block (bb) is always executed at least once, making it the hottest block by default.\n  - The mapping of blocks from the -O0 version to the optimized version is straightforward, as the structure of the function remains largely intact. No blocks were split, merged, or removed.\n  - The computed freq(bb) table for the -O0 version is uniform, with all blocks having a frequency of 0.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."

This means no execution data is available, so all blocks are assumed to have equal likelihood of execution.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: The optimized function introduces preheaders and critical edge blocks, but no blocks are entirely removed. The control flow remains consistent with the original function.\n  - **Summary Line**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
