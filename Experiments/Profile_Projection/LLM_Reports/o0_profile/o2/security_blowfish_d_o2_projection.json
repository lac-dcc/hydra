For example, bb157 in -O0 corresponds to bb119 in -O2, as both represent the main loop processing the encryption logic.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - bb157: 17,820,693\n    - bb160: 17,820,594\n    - bb167: 17,820,594\n    - bb135: 100\n    - bb139: 99\n    - bb140: 4,055\n    - bb143: 4,054\n    - bb145: 4,055\n    - bb147: 3,956\n    - bb172: 3,956\n    - bb178: 3,956\n    - Remaining blocks have lower frequencies.\n  - **Block Splits/Merges**:\n    - bb157, bb160, and bb167 in -O0 were merged into bb119 in -O2.\n    - Some blocks were split into smaller blocks in -O2 for optimization purposes, but their frequencies were aggregated based on the -O0 profile.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 51 (confirmed)."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function introduces critical edge blocks (bb52.bb80_crit_edge, bb80.bb52_crit_edge, etc.) that do not exist in the original function. These are artifacts of optimization to simplify control flow.\n    - The loop structure (bb81, bb124) in the original function is transformed into bb52, bb80, and their associated critical edges.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, the loop body (bb52) is likely the hottest block because it represents the main computation. The loop continuation (bb80) and the BF_encrypt call (bb62) follow in hotness.\n    - Cleanup and finalization blocks (bb96, bb111) are less frequently executed, as they occur after the loop terminates.\n    - Entry and preheader blocks (bb, bb52.preheader) are executed only once, making them the least hot.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
