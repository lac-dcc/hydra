    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The hottest block in the original profile (bb36) corresponds to the loop in the optimized function, which processes the main workload. This block is executed 5,000,000 times, as indicated by the profile.\n    - Blocks like bb70, bb54, and bb63 are part of the same loop and inherit their hotness from the original loop structure.\n    - Blocks such as bb6, bb9, and bb17 correspond to initialization and error handling, which are executed less frequently.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the original function was used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb70.bb36_crit_edge) are split versions of the original loop structure. Their hotness is derived from the parent block in the original profile.\n    - Blocks like bb and bb6 are initialization blocks and are executed only once or a few times.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
