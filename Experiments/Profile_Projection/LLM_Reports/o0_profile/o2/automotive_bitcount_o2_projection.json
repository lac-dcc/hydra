This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function introduces loop-related blocks (bb5.preheader, bb5.bb5_crit_edge, bb16.loopexit) that were not explicitly present in the O0 version. These are derived from the loop structure in the original function.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Without execution data, the entry block (bb) is assumed to be the hottest as it is always executed.\n    - The block bb.bb16_crit_edge is likely executed next as it directly follows bb.\n    - The loop-related blocks (bb5.preheader, bb5, bb5.bb5_crit_edge, bb16.loopexit) are ranked lower due to the absence of loop execution data.\n    - The exit block (bb16) is ranked higher than loop-related blocks as it is part of the function's termination path.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."
