Entry blocks and loop headers were prioritized as they are likely to be executed more frequently.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - **Block Transformations**: No blocks were explicitly split, merged, or removed in the optimized function. However, some blocks were renamed or restructured due to optimization passes.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 56."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping was based on the -O0 profile data and the structure of the optimized function. Blocks with high execution counts in the -O0 profile (e.g., 36, 38, 83) were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 profile was used to estimate the hotness of blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the -O0 version were split or merged in the optimized version. For example, 36 in the -O0 version corresponds to bb11 and its surrounding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 143 blocks, as required."
