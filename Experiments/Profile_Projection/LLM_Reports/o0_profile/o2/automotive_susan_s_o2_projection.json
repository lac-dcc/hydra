    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping from the -O0 profile to the optimized function is trivial because all basic blocks in the -O0 profile have zero execution counts. This means no block in the optimized function can be definitively identified as \"hotter\" than another based on the given profile data.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0.\n  - **Block Transformations**: No blocks were split, merged, or removed in a way that affects the analysis. The optimized function retains the structure of the original function, but the profiling data does not provide any differentiation.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 31."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping from the -O0 profile to the optimized function was based on structural analysis of the control flow graph (CFG). Entry blocks and frequently traversed paths in the -O0 version were projected onto their corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - **Block Transformations**: No specific blocks were identified as split, merged, or removed during optimization. However, the optimized function introduces additional blocks for control flow simplifications and loop transformations.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **56**, matching the expected count."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's basic blocks (bb, bb4, bb9, bb11, bb40, bb55, bb56) were mapped to the optimized function's blocks based on their logical structure and control flow.\n    - For example, bb4 in the original corresponds to the loop header bb10 in the optimized version, while bb56 corresponds to the exit block bb44.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This means no execution data is available, so the analysis relies on structural reasoning.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function has split some blocks (e.g., bb38 and bb38.bb10_crit_edge) and merged others. For instance, bb55 and bb4 in the original are part of the loop structure in the optimized version.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - The entry block bb is always executed, making it the hottest.\n    - bb.bb44_crit_edge and bb44 are part of the critical path for exiting the function.\n    - Loop-related blocks (bb10, bb38, bb38.bb10_crit_edge) are likely executed multiple times but depend on the loop condition.\n    - Blocks like bb15 and bb31 are conditionally executed, making them less hot.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."
