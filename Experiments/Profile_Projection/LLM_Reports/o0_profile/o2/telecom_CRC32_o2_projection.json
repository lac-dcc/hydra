For example, bb in the optimized function corresponds to the entry block in the -O0 version.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, meaning no execution counts were recorded. This makes it impossible to infer hotness directly from the profile.\n  - **Block Transformations**: The optimized function introduces additional blocks (e.g., bb7.bb7_crit_edge, bb31.loopexit) due to loop unrolling and other optimizations. These blocks are derived from the original loop structure.\n  - **Assumptions**: Since all -O0 profile counts are zero, the hotness ranking is based on structural importance and execution likelihood inferred from the control flow graph.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."
