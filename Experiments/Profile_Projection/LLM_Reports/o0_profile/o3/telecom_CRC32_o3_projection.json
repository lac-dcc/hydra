The loop structure in the original function (bb4, bb5, bb14) was unrolled and split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (bb7, bb7.bb7_crit_edge, bb31, etc.).\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the O0 profile have a frequency of 0, indicating no execution data was collected. This makes it impossible to infer hotness directly from the profile.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: The loop in the original function was unrolled in the optimized version, resulting in new blocks like bb7.bb7_crit_edge and bb31.loopexit. Some blocks like bb14 were effectively split into multiple blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**: Since all O0 profile counts are zero, the entry block bb is assumed to be the hottest as it is always executed. Other blocks are sorted based on their structural position and likelihood of execution in the absence of profile data.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."
