For example, bb396 has the highest count (1,806,098), followed by bb400 and bb518 (1,677,091 each).\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function are split versions of blocks in the original function. For example, bb8 and bb8.bb13_crit_edge are split versions of bb8 in the original function.\n    - Similarly, bb252, bb252.bb252_crit_edge, and bb252.preheader are split versions of a loop in the original function.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **31**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

However, due to the lack of execution counts in the -O0 profile (all counts are zero), the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of the blocks in the control flow graph.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, so no direct frequency-based ranking is possible.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No explicit evidence of block splitting or merging is provided in the profile data. The optimized function appears to have additional blocks due to optimizations like loop unrolling and control flow restructuring.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 40. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
