    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The mapping between the -O0 and -O3 blocks was inferred based on the control flow structure and the edge profile. For example, bb13 in the optimized function corresponds to the main loop body in the original function, which includes blocks like 34, 45, 51, and 58 in the -O0 version.\n    - Blocks like bb72 and bb68 correspond to decision-making points in the loop, derived from the -O0 blocks 73 and 66.\n    - bb84 corresponds to the final state update, mapped from 112 in the -O0 version.\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the -O0 version was directly taken from the basic block profile. For example, 34 and 51 had the highest counts (512,989,884), which dominate the loop body.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function merges several blocks from the -O0 version into fewer blocks. For instance, bb13 in the optimized function combines the functionality of multiple blocks like 34, 45, 51, and 58 from the -O0 version.\n    - Some blocks like bb72 and bb68 represent decision points that were streamlined in the optimized version.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This makes it impossible to directly infer hotness from the profile.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into smaller blocks in the optimized function (e.g., critical edges like bb.bb71_crit_edge).\n    - The optimized function has fewer blocks overall due to merging and simplification.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Since all blocks in the original profile have a frequency of 0, the ranking is based on the structural importance of the blocks in the optimized function.\n    - The entry block (bb) is the hottest because it is always executed.\n    - Blocks like bb7 and bb13 are ranked higher because they are closer to the entry and likely part of the main execution path.\n    - Critical edge blocks (bb.bb71_crit_edge, bb28.bb13_crit_edge) are ranked lower as they are auxiliary and less likely to dominate execution.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10.
