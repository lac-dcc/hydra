However, due to the lack of execution counts in the profile (all counts are zero), the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of blocks in the control flow graph. Entry blocks (bb) are assumed to be the hottest, followed by blocks directly connected to them.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, so no direct frequency-based ranking is possible.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No evidence of block splitting or merging is observed in the provided IR. The optimized function retains the structure of the original function, albeit with additional blocks for optimization purposes.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 51 blocks are listed, matching the total number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected properly.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - Despite the lack of profiling data, the structure of the function suggests that the loop in bb52 and bb80 is the most likely hotspot, as it processes the main encryption logic.\n    - Blocks like bb62 and bb96 are part of the loop or handle key operations, making them relatively hot.\n    - Blocks like bb, bb.bb111_crit_edge, and bb52.bb80_crit_edge are less likely to be executed frequently, as they handle setup or edge cases.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The loop structure in the original (bb81, bb124) was optimized into bb52, bb80, and related blocks.\n    - Exit handling (bb137, bb139, bb174) was streamlined into bb94, bb96, and bb111.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12."
