    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping between the -O0 and -O3 versions is straightforward for most blocks, as the structure of the function remains largely intact. However, some blocks in the optimized version are split or merged due to loop unrolling and other optimizations.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, as indicated in the provided profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb15.bb31_crit_edge, bb31.bb15_crit_edge) are the result of splitting due to loop optimizations. These are treated as separate blocks in the hotness ranking.\n  - **Assumptions**: Since all profile counts are 0, the ranking assumes uniform execution likelihood across all blocks, with the entry block (bb) being the hottest due to its position as the starting point.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 31."
