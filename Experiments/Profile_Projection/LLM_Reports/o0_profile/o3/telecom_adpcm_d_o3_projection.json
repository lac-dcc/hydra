This suggests that the profiling data is either incomplete or the function was not executed during profiling.\n  - **Block Transformations**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were merged or optimized away in the O3 version. For example, critical edges in the original function were split into separate blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb72.bb13_crit_edge).\n    - The optimized function has fewer redundant computations and uses more compact control flow.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
