The basic blocks in the optimized function correspond directly to those in the original function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic block counts and edge counts in the O0 profile are zero. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Estimation**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, bb4 is the central block in the control flow, as it contains the main loop and branches to other blocks. It is likely to be the hottest block based on its role in the function.\n    - bb9, bb11, bb40, and bb55 are part of the loop and are expected to execute frequently, but less often than bb4.\n    - bb is the entry block and executes only once.\n    - bb56 is the exit block and executes only once.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."
