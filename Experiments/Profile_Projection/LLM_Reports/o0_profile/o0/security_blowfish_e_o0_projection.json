    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the original function to the optimized function was straightforward for most blocks, as the structure of the control flow graph (CFG) remained largely unchanged. The hottest blocks in the original function (e.g., bb157, bb160, bb167) correspond directly to their counterparts in the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived from the basic block and edge profiles of the original function. For example, bb157 in the original function had the highest execution count (17,820,693), making it the hottest block.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No significant block splitting or merging was observed between the original and optimized functions. However, some blocks (e.g., bb53.bb59_crit_edge, bb61.bb77.ce) were introduced in the optimized function to handle critical edges, but their execution counts were derived from the corresponding edges in the original function.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 62 blocks, as required."
