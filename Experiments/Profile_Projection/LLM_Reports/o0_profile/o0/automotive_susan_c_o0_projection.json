It is part of the loop structure, and its execution count matches the loop iterations.\n    - bb14 is the second hottest block, also executed 782 times, as it precedes bb15 in the loop.\n    - bb11 is executed 783 times, but it includes one entry from bb8 and one exit to bb17, making it slightly less \"hot\" in terms of loop iterations.\n    - bb8 is executed once, as it handles the file reading logic.\n    - bb17, bb18, and bb are executed once each, with bb17 being part of the loop exit path.\n    - bb5 is never executed, as indicated by the profile data.\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 8.

The profile data from the original function was directly applied to the optimized function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the original function had a frequency of 0, as indicated in the profile data.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No blocks were split, merged, or removed during optimization. The block names and structure were preserved.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 138."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the original function to the optimized function was based on control flow and the profiling data. For example, bb36 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in the original function, which had the highest execution count (1564).\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the original function was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb.bb33_crit_edge, bb45.bb81_crit_edge) were introduced due to critical edge splitting. These were assigned frequencies based on their predecessors and successors.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 57 blocks, as required."
