The block names and control flow remain consistent.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the original function have a frequency of 0 in the profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Reasoning**: Since all blocks have a frequency of 0, the entry block (bb) is assumed to be the hottest as it is the starting point of the function. The remaining blocks are sorted in the order they appear in the control flow graph.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

    "additionalNotes": "- The profile data for the -O0 version shows all basic block counts and edge counts as 0. This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data is incomplete.\n  - Without execution data, the \"hotness\" ranking is based on the control flow structure and the assumption that the entry block (bb) is the starting point and thus the most likely to be executed.\n  - The mapping of blocks from the original to the optimized version is straightforward as the structure of the function remains unchanged. No blocks were split, merged, or removed.\n  - The computed freq(bb) table for the -O0 version is all zeros, so no further insights can be derived from the profile data.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
