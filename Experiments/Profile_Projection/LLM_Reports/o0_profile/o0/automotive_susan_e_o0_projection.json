The basic blocks in the optimized function correspond directly to those in the original function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic block counts and edge counts in the O0 profile are zero. This means there is no runtime data to directly infer hotness. However, bb4 is the entry point of the loop, and loops are typically the hottest regions in a function due to repeated execution.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**: \n    - bb4 is the loop header and is likely executed the most frequently.\n    - bb9 is the first block after bb4 and determines the path taken within the loop.\n    - bb11 and bb40 are the two main paths within the loop, with bb11 likely being slightly hotter due to its position in the control flow.\n    - bb55 is the loop latch, executed at the end of each iteration.\n    - bb is the function entry block, executed once.\n    - bb56 is the function exit block, executed once.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 7."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: The mapping was done by analyzing the control flow and structure of the original and optimized functions. For example, bb36 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in the original function, which has the highest execution count (748).\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the original function was directly used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized function.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb.bb33_crit_edge, bb45.bb81_crit_edge) are split versions of blocks in the original function. Their hotness was derived from the parent block's frequency.\n  - **Total Blocks in Sorted List**: 57 blocks. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
