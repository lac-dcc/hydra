Critical edges (e.g., bb34.bb45_crit_edge) were introduced in the optimized version to simplify the CFG.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the optimized function was derived by projecting the execution counts from the original function's profile data. For blocks that were split or merged, their frequencies were distributed or summed accordingly.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb34.bb45_crit_edge, bb45.bb51_crit_edge) were introduced as critical edges, and their frequencies were derived from the corresponding edges in the original function. No blocks were removed entirely.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 38."
