For example, bb396 in the optimized function corresponds to the loop in the original function that processes the most iterations, as indicated by the high execution count in the profile.\n    - Blocks like bb400 and bb518 are part of the same loop and inherit the high execution count from the original function's loop structure.\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the original function was directly taken from the .bb_profile and .edge_profile data.\n    - These frequencies were then projected onto the optimized function by identifying corresponding blocks and loops.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb49.preheader, bb49.bb49_crit_edge) are artifacts of loop restructuring and do not have direct counterparts in the original function. Their hotness was inferred based on their position in the control flow.\n    - Blocks like bb234.loopexit, bb234.loopexit1, and bb234.loopexit2 are exit points for loops and are less frequently executed.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **28**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

However, some blocks in the optimized version are split or merged versions of blocks in the original function.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, as indicated in the provided profile data. This means no execution data is available to differentiate the hotness of blocks.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version (e.g., bb.bb8_crit_edge, bb12.bb29_crit_edge) are split versions of blocks in the original function. These were included in the sorted list based on their structural position in the control flow graph.\n  - **Hotness Ranking**: Since all blocks have a frequency of 0 in the -O0 profile, the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of blocks in the control flow graph, starting from the entry block.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 39."
