This means no execution data is available to directly infer hotness.\n\n  - **Block Splitting, Merging, or Removal**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into smaller blocks in the optimized function (e.g., critical edges like bb.bb72_crit_edge).\n    - The optimized function has fewer blocks overall due to merging and simplification.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness Ranking**:\n    - Without execution data, the entry block (bb) is assumed to be the hottest as it is always executed.\n    - Blocks within the loop (bb7, bb13, bb28) are ranked higher due to their role in iterative processing.\n    - Critical edges and less frequently executed blocks (e.g., bb.bb72_crit_edge) are ranked lower.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."
