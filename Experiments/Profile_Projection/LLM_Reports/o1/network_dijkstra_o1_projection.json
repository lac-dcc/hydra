    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The hottest block in the original function (82) corresponds to bb82 in the optimized function. This is evident from the loop structure and the high execution count in the profile.\n    - Blocks 85 and 86 in the original function are part of the same loop as 82 and correspond to bb85 and bb86 in the optimized function.\n    - Blocks like 56, 59, and 68 in the original function map to parts of the nested loops in the optimized function, such as bb56, bb59, and bb68.\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - The frequency of each block in the original function was directly taken from the .bb_profile and .edge_profile data.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split into multiple blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb82 and its successors).\n    - Some blocks were merged or optimized away, but the overall control flow remains consistent.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **29**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
