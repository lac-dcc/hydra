Blocks with similar functionality and control flow were matched.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 version was directly used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version were split or merged, but the overall control flow structure was preserved. For example, bb140 and bb142 in the optimized version correspond to the hottest loop in the -O0 version.\n\n---\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **79**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping from the -O0 profile to the optimized function was based on structural analysis of the control flow graph (CFG). Blocks in the optimized function were matched to their counterparts in the -O0 version using their roles in the CFG and their relative positions in loops and branches.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected correctly.\n  - **Block Transformations**: Some blocks in the optimized function were split or merged due to optimizations. For example, critical edge splitting introduced blocks like bb.bb28_crit_edge. These were placed in the hotness ranking based on their parent blocks' positions in the CFG.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **58**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, so no runtime data is available to directly infer hotness.\n\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - The optimized function shows evidence of block splitting (e.g., bb38.bb10_crit_edge as a critical edge block) and merging (e.g., loop-related blocks like bb55 and bb56 integrated into bb38).\n\n  - **Hotness Estimation**:\n    - Since all O0 profile counts are 0, the hotness ranking is based on structural analysis:\n      - Entry blocks (bb) are likely to be executed at least once.\n      - Loop-related blocks (bb6, bb10, bb15, bb31, bb38) are prioritized based on their position in the control flow.\n      - Critical edge blocks (bb38.bb10_crit_edge) and exit blocks (bb44.loopexit, bb44) are ranked lower due to their auxiliary roles.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 10."
