However, the entry block (bb) is assumed to be the hottest since it is the starting point of the function. Other blocks are sorted based on their appearance in the control flow graph, assuming uniform execution likelihood due to the absence of non-zero counts in the profile data.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0, making it impossible to distinguish hotness based on the given data.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: No explicit information about block splitting or merging is provided. The analysis assumes a one-to-one mapping between blocks in the -O0 and -O1 versions unless otherwise indicated.\n\n---\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **66**, matching the expected count."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O0 version to the optimized version was based on control flow and the structure of the IR. Blocks with similar functionality and control flow were matched.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 version was directly used to estimate the hotness of corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version were split or merged, but the overall control flow was preserved. For example, bb36 in the optimized version corresponds to the hottest block in the -O0 version.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 109 blocks, as required."
