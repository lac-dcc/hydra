This is due to the compiler's optimization, which merged the control flow and eliminated redundant branches.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - bb: 148,365,384\n    - bb6: 73,275,076\n    - bb7: 75,090,308\n    - bb11: 148,365,384\n  - **Block Merging**: The optimized function combines the logic of all the original blocks into a single block (bb). The profile data from the original function indicates that the entry block (bb) and the final block (bb11) were executed the most frequently, and since all control flow paths converge in the optimized block, it inherits the combined hotness of the original blocks.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 1."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O0 version to the optimized version was based on control flow structure and the profiling data. Blocks with high execution counts in the -O0 profile were mapped to their corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 profile was used to estimate the hotness of the corresponding blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version were split or merged due to optimizations. For example, loops and conditionals were restructured, but the profiling data was used to infer their relative hotness.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The sorted list contains exactly 74 blocks, as required. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
