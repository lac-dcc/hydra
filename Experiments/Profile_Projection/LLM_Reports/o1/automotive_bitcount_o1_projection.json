This means there is no runtime information to differentiate the hotness of blocks based on execution frequency.\n  - Without runtime differentiation, the \"hottest\" block is chosen as the entry block (bb) since it is always executed when the function is called.\n  - The sorted list of blocks is based on their structural order in the optimized function, as no profiling data suggests any other prioritization.\n  - The mapping of blocks from -O0 to -O1 is straightforward, as no blocks were split, merged, or removed in the optimization process.\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13."

The loop structure in the original function (blocks 2, 3, 7, 14) was transformed into a more compact loop in the optimized function (bb4, bb14).\n    - Blocks like bb22 in the optimized function correspond to the exit paths (22) in the original function.\n    - Critical edges (2_12.ce, 3_12.ce) were split into separate blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb.bb22_crit_edge, bb1.bb22_crit_edge).\n\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the -O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was incomplete.\n\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, the loop structure in the optimized function (bb4, bb14) is likely to be the hottest due to its iterative nature.\n    - Entry and exit blocks (bb, bb22) are less likely to be executed as frequently as the loop body.\n    - Critical edge blocks (bb.bb22_crit_edge, bb1.bb22_crit_edge) are expected to have minimal execution counts.\n\n  - **Summary**:\n    - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 12.
