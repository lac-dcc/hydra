These frequencies were then projected onto the optimized blocks.\n  - **Block Transformations**: Some blocks in the -O0 version were split or merged in the optimized version. For instance, loop-related blocks in the -O0 version were unrolled or optimized into multiple smaller blocks in the optimized version.\n  - **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 16.

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**: \n    - The bb in the original function corresponds to the entry block in the optimized function.\n    - The loop structure in the original function (blocks 2, 7, and 9) maps to the loop in the optimized function, primarily involving bb11, bb16, bb24, bb30, and their associated critical edges.\n    - Blocks bb54 and bb88 in the optimized function correspond to the tail-end processing of the SHA algorithm.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - bb0: 321506\n    - bb2: 643012\n    - bb7: 321506\n    - bb9: 321506\n  - **Block Splitting and Merging**:\n    - The loop in the original function (blocks 2, 7, and 9) has been unrolled and optimized into multiple blocks in the optimized function, such as bb11, bb16, bb24, bb30, and their critical edges.\n    - Some blocks in the optimized function (e.g., bb33, bb46, bb50) are part of the loop body and handle specific operations like memory copying and transformations.\n    - Blocks like bb54 and bb88 handle padding and finalization, which were part of the original function's tail-end logic.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 25."
