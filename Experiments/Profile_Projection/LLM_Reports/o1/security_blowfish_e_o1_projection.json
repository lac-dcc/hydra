This indicates that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected properly.\n  - Since no execution data is available, the hotness ranking is based on the structural position of the blocks in the control flow graph. The entry block (bb) is assumed to be the hottest as it is always executed when the function is called.\n  - The mapping of blocks from the original function to the optimized function is straightforward, as the structure of the function remains largely intact. However, without execution data, the ranking is speculative and based on control flow structure.\n  - The total number of blocks in the sorted list is **49**, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function. No blocks are missing or duplicated."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Explanation**: The mapping of blocks from the -O0 version to the optimized version was done by analyzing the control flow and matching the semantics of the blocks. For example, bb157 in the optimized version corresponds to the loop in the -O0 version that processes the most iterations, making it the hottest block.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**: The frequency of each block in the -O0 version was directly taken from the basic block profile and edge profile. For example, bb157 had the highest count of 17,820,693.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**: Some blocks in the optimized version were split or merged compared to the -O0 version. For instance, bb157 in the optimized version corresponds to the loop body in the -O0 version, which was heavily optimized.\n  - **Total Blocks**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 51, matching the number of blocks in the optimized function."

    "additionalNotes": "- **Mapping Old Blocks to New Blocks**:\n    - The original function's basic blocks (81, 84, 86, etc.) were mapped to the optimized function's blocks based on their logical roles and control flow structure. For example, 81 corresponds to bb52 in the optimized function, as it represents the main loop header.\n    - Blocks like 124 in the original function correspond to bb78 in the optimized function, as they represent the loop body.\n    - Exit blocks like 137 and 174 in the original function map to bb92 and bb112 in the optimized function, respectively.\n  - **Computed O0 freq(bb) Table**:\n    - All basic blocks in the O0 profile have a frequency of 0. This suggests that the function was not executed during profiling, or the profiling data was not collected properly.\n  - **Block Splitting/Merging**:\n    - Some blocks in the original function were split or merged in the optimized version. For example, 84 and 84_124.ce in the original function were optimized into bb52 and bb52.bb78_crit_edge.\n    - Similarly, 137 and 137_174.ce were optimized into bb92 and bb92.bb112_crit_edge.\n  - **Reasoning for Hotness**:\n    - Despite the lack of execution data, the loop structure suggests that bb52 (loop header) and bb78 (loop body) are the hottest blocks, as they are part of the main loop.\n    - Blocks like bb60 (loop initialization) and bb78.bb52_crit_edge (loop continuation) are also likely to be executed frequently.\n    - Exit blocks like bb92 and bb112 are less likely to be executed as often as the loop blocks.\n\n- **Summary**:\n  The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 13. No blocks are missing or duplicated."
