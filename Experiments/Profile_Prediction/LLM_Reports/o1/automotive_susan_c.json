Blocks like `bb40` and `bb49` are part of another loop, making them moderately hot. Blocks such as `bb`, `bb.bb35_crit_edge`, and `bb35.bb53_crit_edge` are less likely to be executed frequently as they are primarily used for control flow transitions.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb15.bb31_crit_edge` and `bb31.bb15_crit_edge` are critical edges and are less likely to dominate execution frequency compared to the main loop blocks."

It contains multiple `phi` nodes and is a critical convergence point for several paths, making it highly likely to be executed frequently.\n2. **Loop Dominance**: Blocks like `bb11`, `bb62`, and their associated edges dominate the execution due to their placement in loops.\n3. **Cold Blocks**: Blocks like `bb6` and `bb` are less likely to be executed because they are part of early exits or error handling paths.\n4. **Ranking Methodology**: The ranking is based on control flow analysis, loop structures, and the likelihood of execution paths. Blocks within loops or those with multiple incoming edges are ranked higher."
