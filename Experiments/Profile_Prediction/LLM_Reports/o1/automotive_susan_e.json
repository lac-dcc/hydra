It is executed repeatedly as part of the loop structure.\n  - Blocks like `bb623`, `bb843`, and `bb847` are also hot due to their involvement in nested loops and frequent branching.\n  - Blocks such as `bb840` and `bb851` are less hot as they are part of exit conditions or error handling paths.\n  - The ranking is based on the structure of the loops, the number of incoming edges, and the likelihood of execution paths."
