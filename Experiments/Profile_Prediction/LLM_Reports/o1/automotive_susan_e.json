    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is bb15 because it contains a loop with a high likelihood of multiple iterations, as indicated by the phi nodes and the loop structure. The loop iterates over elements and performs multiple memory operations, making it a hotspot.\n  - Blocks like bb31 and bb20 are also part of the same loop and are executed frequently within the loop body.\n  - Blocks such as bb, bb5, and bb35 are less hot because they are primarily involved in setup or branching logic.\n  - Critical edge blocks (e.g., bb.bb35_crit_edge, bb5.bb35_crit_edge) are less likely to be executed frequently compared to the main loop blocks.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 21."
