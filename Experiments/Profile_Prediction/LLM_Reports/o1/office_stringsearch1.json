    "additionalNotes": "1. The hottest block, `bb12`, is part of the main loop where the function processes each character of the input string. It contains the core logic for table lookups and branching decisions, making it the most frequently executed block.\n2. Blocks like `bb7`, `bb10`, and `bb29` are also part of the loop structure and are executed repeatedly, though less frequently than `bb12`.\n3. Blocks such as `bb32`, `bb.bb32_crit_edge`, and `bb` are less likely to be executed often, as they are primarily involved in setup or termination logic.\n4. The function appears to implement a string search algorithm, with `bb12` handling the main character-by-character processing and table lookups."

It is likely to be executed repeatedly for each line of input, making it the most frequently executed block.\n2. Blocks like `bb44`, `bb74`, and `bb98` are also part of loops or repetitive structures, contributing to their high hotness ranking.\n3. Blocks such as `bb6`, `bb13`, and `bb21` are error-handling blocks that terminate the program. These are less likely to be executed unless specific error conditions are met.\n4. The ranking assumes typical program execution paths and does not account for unusual or edge-case inputs that might alter the control flow."
