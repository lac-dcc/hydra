    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb12` because it is part of a loop structure, and loops typically dominate execution frequency in programs. The loop iterates based on the value loaded into `%i`, and the block `bb12` contains the core loop body.\n  - `bb12.bb12_crit_edge` and `bb12.preheader` are closely tied to the loop, with `bb12.bb12_crit_edge` being the critical edge for the loop continuation and `bb12.preheader` setting up the loop.\n  - `bb21.loopexit` is executed once when the loop exits, making it less hot than the loop blocks but still hotter than non-loop blocks.\n  - `bb7` is executed if the file opens successfully, and it leads to the loop. It is less hot than the loop but more frequent than error-handling blocks.\n  - `bb7.bb21_crit_edge` is a connector block and is executed once per loop exit, making it less hot than `bb7`.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed once, making it cooler than the above blocks.\n  - `bb21` is the final block where the function returns, executed once after all other blocks.\n  - `bb4` is the error-handling block for file opening failure, which is the least likely to execute under normal conditions."
