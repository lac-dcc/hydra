Blocks like `bb7` and `bb23` are executed less frequently as they are part of the setup or intermediate stages of the loop.\n5. `bb69` and `bb72` are executed at the end of the loop or function, making them less hot.\n6. `bb.bb72_crit_edge` and `bb` are executed only once during the function's entry, making them among the least hot.\n7. `bb13.bb28_crit_edge` is a critical edge but is less significant in terms of execution frequency compared to the main loop blocks."

They are unlikely to be executed frequently.\n3. **Intermediate Hotness**: Blocks like `bb27` and `bb9` are part of the main control flow but are not part of the loop, so they are executed less frequently than the loop blocks.\n4. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb22.bb22_crit_edge` and `bb27.bb9_crit_edge` are part of the loop or its control flow, so they are relatively hot.\n5. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb31` and `bb31split` are executed once at the end of the function, making them less hot."
