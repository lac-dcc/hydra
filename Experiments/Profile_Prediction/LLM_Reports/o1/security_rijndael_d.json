    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb12` because it is part of the loop body, and loops typically dominate execution time due to repeated iterations. The loop structure is evident from the `br` instructions and the `icmp` condition in `bb12` and its related blocks.\n  - `bb12.bb12_crit_edge` and `bb12.preheader` are closely tied to the loop, so they are also hot but slightly less so than the loop body itself.\n  - `bb18.loopexit` is executed once when the loop exits, making it less hot than the loop-related blocks.\n  - `bb7` is executed if the file opens successfully, and it leads to the loop, so it is moderately hot.\n  - `bb7.bb18_crit_edge` is a transition block, executed when the loop condition fails, making it less hot than `bb7`.\n  - `bb18` is the final block where the function concludes, so it is cooler than the loop-related blocks.\n  - `bb` is the entry block, executed once, making it cooler than most blocks.\n  - `bb4` is executed only if the file fails to open, which is an error path, making it the least hot block."
