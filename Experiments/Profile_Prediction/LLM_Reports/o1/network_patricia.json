The loop iterates based on the value of `%i10`, which is loaded from `%i` and compared against `%i15`. This suggests that the loop could execute multiple times depending on the input.\n  - `bb12.bb12_crit_edge` and `bb12.preheader` are closely tied to the loop, so they are also hot but slightly less frequent than `bb12` itself.\n  - `bb21.loopexit` is executed once when the loop exits, making it less hot than the loop blocks.\n  - `bb7` is executed if the file pointer `%i2` is not null, and it leads to the loop. It is less hot than the loop but more frequent than error-handling blocks.\n  - `bb7.bb21_crit_edge` is a connector block and is executed once per loop iteration, but it does not contain significant computation.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed once.\n  - `bb21` is the final block where the function returns, executed once after all other blocks.\n  - `bb4` handles the error case when the file pointer `%i2` is null, making it the least hot block since it depends on an error condition."
