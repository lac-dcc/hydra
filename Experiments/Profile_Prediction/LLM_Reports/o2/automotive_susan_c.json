Blocks outside loops or those acting as critical edges are colder.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb355.bb130_crit_edge` and `bb233.bb355_crit_edge` are less hot as they serve as connectors between hotter blocks.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb361.loopexit` and `bb358.loopexit` are executed only once when loops terminate, making them among the coldest."
