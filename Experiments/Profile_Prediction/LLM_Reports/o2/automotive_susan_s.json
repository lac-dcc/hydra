This suggests it is part of the main loop body, making it the most frequently executed block.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks like `bb31`, `bb20`, and `bb43` are also part of loops or are closely tied to the main loop, making them relatively hot. Blocks like `bb74` and `bb` are less likely to be executed frequently as they are primarily exit or entry points.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks with names like `bb15.bb31_crit_edge` or `bb6.bb74_crit_edge` are critical edges introduced during IR transformations. These are less likely to be hot unless they are part of a loop or frequently traversed path."

This block is likely executed repeatedly due to its position in the innermost loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb39`, `bb23`, and `bb377` are also part of the loop structure and are executed frequently, but less so than `bb374`.\n  - Blocks such as `bb831` and `bb844` are less frequently executed as they are part of exit conditions or cleanup code.\n  - Critical edge blocks (e.g., `bb23.bb377_crit_edge`) are generally less hot as they serve as connectors between other blocks."
