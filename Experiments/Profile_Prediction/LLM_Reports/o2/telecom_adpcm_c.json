Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function.\n  - `bb13` is the next hottest because it is the main body of the loop and is executed for each iteration.\n  - `bb7` is executed once before entering the loop, making it less hot than the loop body but still significant.\n  - `bb78` and `bb82` are part of the loop's exit sequence, making them moderately hot.\n  - `bb84` is the final block where the function concludes, so it is executed once after the loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb68`, `bb65`, and `bb78.bb84_crit_edge` are less frequently executed as they are part of conditional branches or edge cases.\n  - `bb72.bb13_crit_edge` and `bb.bb84_crit_edge` are critical edges but are not directly part of the main loop body, so they are colder.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once, making it the coldest."
