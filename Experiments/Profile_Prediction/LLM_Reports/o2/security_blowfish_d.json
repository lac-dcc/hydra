This loop is likely to execute multiple times, making `bb82` the most frequently executed block.\n2. **Loop Analysis**: The function contains two main loops:\n   - The first loop involves `bb82` and its successors (`bb82.bb30_crit_edge`, `bb30`, `bb37`).\n   - The second loop involves `bb93` and its successors (`bb93.bb145_crit_edge`, `bb145`, `bb100`).\n   The first loop appears to dominate execution due to its structure and the operations performed.\n3. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb156`, `bb156.loopexit`, and `bb156.loopexit1` are less frequently executed as they serve as loop exits or final cleanup.\n4. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb10.bb156_crit_edge` and `bb20.bb156_crit_edge` are unlikely to be hot since they are primarily used for control flow transitions."
