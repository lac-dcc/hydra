This makes it the \"hottest\" block as it is always reached regardless of the branch taken.  \n  - The `bb` block is the entry block and is executed once per function invocation, making it the second hottest.  \n  - The `bb4` block is executed only if the condition `%i3` evaluates to true, which depends on the value of `%i2`. Its execution frequency is conditional, so it ranks third.  \n  - The `bb.bb10_crit_edge` block is executed only if the condition `%i3` evaluates to false, making it the least likely to execute if `%i3` is often true."

Critical edge blocks (e.g., `bb18.bb75_crit_edge`, `bb58.bb72_crit_edge`) are generally cooler as they serve as connectors and are not part of the main computation.\n6.
