    "additionalNotes": "1. **Hot Block Estimation**: The hottest block is `bb14` because it contains the main loop that iterates over the key schedule (`icmp slt i32 %.02, 18`) and processes 18 iterations. This block is the entry point for the loop and is revisited frequently.\n2. **Loop Nesting**: The blocks `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, `bb38`, and `bb46` are part of the inner loop that processes bytes of the key material. These blocks are executed multiple times per iteration of the outer loop, making them hotter than others.\n3. **Outer Loop**: Blocks like `bb56`, `bb58`, `bb69`, `bb74`, and `bb76` are part of the outer loop that processes the key schedule and S-box initialization. These are executed less frequently than the inner loop blocks.\n4. **Cold Blocks**: Blocks like `bb`, `bb10`, `bb53`, and `bb89` are executed only once or conditionally, making them the least hot."
