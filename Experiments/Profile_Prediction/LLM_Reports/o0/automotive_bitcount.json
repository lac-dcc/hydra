    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb11` because it contains a loop structure (`br label %bb11`) that iterates based on the comparison of `%.01` and `%i12`. Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function due to repeated execution.\n  - `bb14` and `bb20` are part of the loop body, so they are also hot but slightly less frequent than `bb11` due to branching conditions.\n  - `bb22` is executed after the loop exits, making it less hot than the loop blocks.\n  - `bb8` is executed once after the file is opened, so it is cooler than the loop-related blocks.\n  - `bb23` is the final block, executed once at the end of the function.\n  - `bb5` is executed only if the file opening fails, making it less frequent.\n  - `bb` is the entry block and is executed only once, making it the least hot."
