This block is likely executed multiple times due to its position in the innermost loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb204`, `bb216`, and others in the same loop nest are also hot but slightly less so as they are part of the same iterative structure.\n  - Blocks with `.bb1467_crit_edge` suffixes are less likely to be executed frequently as they represent critical edges, which are often used for rare control flow paths or edge cases."

This makes it the most frequently executed block in the function.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks within the loop (`bb36`, `bb38`, `bb45`, etc.) are ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside the loop or those handling specific conditions (e.g., `bb32`, `bb82`) are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb45.bb81_crit_edge` and `bb62.bb70_crit_edge` are less likely to dominate execution as they serve as intermediate transitions.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb191` and `bb152` are ranked lower as they are executed once at the end of the function."
