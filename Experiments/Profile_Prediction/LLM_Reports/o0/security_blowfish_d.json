    "additionalNotes": "1. The hottest block, `bb14`, is part of a loop that iterates over 18 elements, making it the most frequently executed block. It contains the main loop header and controls the iteration.\n2. Blocks `bb16`, `bb22`, `bb30`, `bb38`, and `bb46` are part of the same loop and are executed in sequence for each iteration, making them relatively hot.\n3. The second loop starting at `bb56` iterates over 18 elements, making blocks like `bb56`, `bb58`, and `bb69` moderately hot.\n4. The third loop starting at `bb74` iterates over 1024 elements, making `bb74`, `bb76`, and `bb87` hot but less so than the first loop due to fewer operations per iteration.\n5. Blocks like `bb`, `bb.bb11_crit_edge`, and `bb10` are executed only once, making them the least hot."
