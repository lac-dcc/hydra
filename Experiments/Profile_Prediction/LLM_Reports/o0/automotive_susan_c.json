    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block, bb36, is part of the main loop and contains multiple phi nodes, indicating it is revisited frequently.\n  - Blocks like bb83, bb38, and bb45 are also part of the loop structure and are likely executed often.\n  - Blocks such as bb49, bb50, etc., are part of the switch-case structure and are less likely to be executed as frequently as the loop blocks.\n  - Blocks like bb60, bb82, and bb are less likely to be executed often due to their placement in error-handling or initialization paths.\n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 57."
