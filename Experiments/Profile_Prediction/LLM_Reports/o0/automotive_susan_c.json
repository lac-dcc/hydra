    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block `bb20` is part of a nested loop structure, as evidenced by its repeated branching back to itself and its predecessors. This suggests it is executed frequently.\n  - Blocks like `bb204`, `bb216`, and others in the same loop nest are also likely to be hot due to their proximity to the hottest block and their role in the iterative computation.\n  - Blocks with `.bbXXX_crit_edge` suffixes are less likely to be hot as they represent critical edges, which are typically executed less frequently than the main loop body.\n  - The function appears to perform a computationally intensive operation, possibly involving image processing or matrix manipulation, given the heavy use of `getelementptr` and arithmetic operations."

Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks within the loop (`bb38`, `bb45`, `bb81`, `bb83`) are ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside the loop or those handling rare conditions (e.g., `bb60`, `bb74`) are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb45.bb81_crit_edge` and `bb143.bb148_crit_edge` are less likely to be executed frequently as they serve as intermediate paths.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb191` are executed once at the end, making them less hot than loop-related blocks."
