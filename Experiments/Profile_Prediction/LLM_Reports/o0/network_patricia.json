    "additionalNotes": "1. **Hottest Block (`bb47`)**: This block contains the main loop that processes input lines using `fgets`. It is likely to be executed repeatedly for each line in the input file, making it the hottest block.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks within the loop (`bb47`, `bb51`, `bb57`, `bb64`, `bb75`, etc.) are ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside the loop (e.g., `bb6`, `bb10`, `bb15`) are executed only once or conditionally, so they are ranked lower.\n3. **Error Handling Blocks**: Blocks like `bb22`, `bb29`, `bb40`, `bb56`, `bb63`, and `bb74` handle errors and terminate the program. These are less likely to be executed unless specific conditions are met, so they are ranked lower.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb123` and `bb119` handle cleanup and termination. They are executed once at the end of the function, so they are ranked accordingly."
