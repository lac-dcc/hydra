    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb1` because it is part of the first loop that iterates up to 256 times, which is a fixed upper bound. This loop is likely to dominate execution frequency.  \n  - Blocks `bb3` and `bb6` are part of the same loop as `bb1` and are executed in each iteration, making them the next hottest.  \n  - The second loop starts at `bb9` and iterates based on the length of the input string (`len`). Blocks `bb12` and `bb20` are part of this loop and are executed in each iteration, but the number of iterations depends on the input length, which is less predictable than the fixed bound of the first loop.  \n  - Blocks `bb`, `bb8`, and `bb22` are executed only once, making them the least hot.  \n\n- **Summary**: The total number of blocks in the sorted list is exactly 9."
