The nested nature of the loops amplifies its execution count.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: The ranking is based on the control flow structure, with blocks inside nested loops ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside loops or those that serve as exit points are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb35.bb44_crit_edge` and `bb37.bb44_crit_edge` are less likely to be hot as they serve as connectors and do not contain significant computation.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb340` and `bb185` are ranked lowest as they are terminal blocks and execute only once per function invocation."

This block is likely executed frequently due to its position in the innermost loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb26`, `bb22`, and `bb213` are also part of the loop structure and are executed frequently as part of the loop iterations.\n  - Critical edge blocks (e.g., `bb29.bb1066_crit_edge`) are less likely to be executed as often as their parent blocks, as they represent intermediate paths in the control flow."

Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function.\n2. **Sorting Rationale**: Blocks within the loop (`bb36`, `bb38`, `bb45`, etc.) are ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside the loop or those handling rare conditions (e.g., `bb32`, `bb82`) are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb45.bb81_crit_edge` and `bb143.bb148_crit_edge` are intermediate and less likely to dominate execution frequency compared to their parent blocks."
