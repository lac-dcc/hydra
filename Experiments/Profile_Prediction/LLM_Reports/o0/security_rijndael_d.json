    "additionalNotes": "1. **Hottest Block Analysis**: `bb29` is the hottest block because it contains a loop structure (`llvm.loop` metadata) that iterates over a range of values, making it the most frequently executed block.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks within the loop (`bb29`, `bb68`, `bb37`, etc.) are ranked higher due to their repeated execution. Blocks outside the loop or those handling specific conditions (e.g., `bb24`, `bb99`) are less likely to be executed frequently.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb29.bb35_crit_edge` and `bb68.bb79_crit_edge` are less likely to be executed as they serve as intermediate transitions.\n4. **Functionality**: The function appears to process input arguments, perform conditional checks, and execute encryption/decryption based on the input."

Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function due to repeated execution.\n  - `bb14` and `bb16` are part of the loop body, so they are also hot but slightly less frequent than `bb11` due to potential early exits.\n  - `bb18` is the loop exit block, executed once after the loop finishes.\n  - `bb8` is executed once for file reading and initialization, making it less hot than the loop-related blocks.\n  - `bb` is the entry block, executed once at the start.\n  - `bb5` is executed only if the file opening fails, making it colder.\n  - `bb19` is the final block, executed once at the end, making it the coldest."
