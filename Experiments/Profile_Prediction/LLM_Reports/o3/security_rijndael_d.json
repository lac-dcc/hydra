    "additionalNotes": "1. The hottest block is `bb12` because it is part of a loop, and loops typically dominate execution time due to repeated iterations. The loop structure involves `bb12`, `bb12.bb12_crit_edge`, and `bb12.preheader`, making these blocks the most frequently executed.\n2. `bb18.loopexit` is executed once when the loop exits, so it is less hot than the loop blocks but still hotter than non-loop blocks.\n3. `bb7` is executed if the file opens successfully, and `bb7.bb18_crit_edge` is a transition block leading to `bb18`. These are less hot than the loop but more frequent than error-handling blocks.\n4. `bb` is the entry block, executed once, and `bb4` handles the error case when the file fails to open, making it the least hot."
