    "additionalNotes": "1. **Hottest Block Analysis**: The block `bb72` is part of a loop structure, as indicated by the `br i1 %i77` instruction and the `!llvm.loop` metadata. Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function due to repeated execution. Within the loop, `bb72` is the central block where most of the computation and control flow decisions occur, making it the hottest.\n\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: \n   - Blocks like `bb13` and `bb7` are also part of the loop and are executed frequently, but they are less central than `bb72`.\n   - Blocks `bb78` and `bb82` are executed after the loop exits, but their execution depends on the loop's state, making them less hot than the loop blocks.\n   - Blocks like `bb68` and `bb65` are conditionally executed within the loop, but their frequency is lower than the main loop body.\n   - Blocks such as `bb78.bb84_crit_edge`, `bb72.bb13_crit_edge`, and `bb.bb84_crit_edge` are primarily used for control flow transitions and are executed less frequently.\n   - The entry block `bb` is executed only once, making it the least hot."
