Blocks outside loops or those that serve as exit points (e.g., `bb533`, `bb304`) are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb72.bb72_crit_edge` and `bb33.bb533_crit_edge` are less likely to be executed as frequently as their parent blocks, hence their lower ranking."

The presence of `llvm.loop` metadata suggests that this loop is a key computational region.\n2. **Hotness Ranking**: Blocks like `bb10.bb10_crit_edge` and `bb35.bb35_crit_edge` are also hot because they are part of the loop structure. Preheader blocks (`bb10.preheader` and `bb35.preheader`) are executed once per loop entry, making them less hot than the loop body. Blocks like `bb51`, `bb.bb51_crit_edge`, and the loop exit blocks (`bb51.loopexit`, `bb51.loopexit1`) are executed less frequently, primarily during loop termination or specific conditions."

    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block `bb829` is part of a nested loop structure, which is evident from the repeated critical edges and the presence of loop-carried dependencies. This block is likely executed multiple times due to its position in the innermost loop.\n  - Blocks like `bb612`, `bb589`, and `bb583` are also part of the loop structure and are executed frequently, but they are less nested compared to `bb829`.\n  - Blocks such as `bb555`, `bb438`, and `bb367` are part of conditional branches and are executed less frequently than the loop-heavy blocks.\n  - The blocks with `.bbXXX_crit_edge` suffixes are critical edges and are less likely to be executed as often as their parent blocks."
