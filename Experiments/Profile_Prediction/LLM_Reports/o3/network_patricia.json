The first loop (`bb36`) is more likely to dominate execution due to its early placement and the absence of conditions that would bypass it.\n3. **Error Handling Blocks**: Blocks like `bb6`, `bb14`, `bb20`, `bb25`, `bb30`, and `bb64` handle error cases and are less likely to execute frequently unless the input or memory allocation fails.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb93` and `bb96` handle cleanup and termination, making them less hot compared to the main processing blocks."
