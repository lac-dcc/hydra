    "additionalNotes": "1. **Hottest Block (`bb22`)**: This block contains a loop that iterates based on the value of `%i25` (loaded from `%i`), which is user-controlled. Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function due to repeated execution.\n2. **`bb22.bb22_crit_edge`**: This block is part of the loop structure and will execute as often as `bb22`.\n3. **`bb27`**: This block follows the loop and processes the results, making it relatively hot but less so than the loop itself.\n4. **`bb9`**: Acts as a central hub for control flow, revisited after the loop and other operations.\n5. **Cold Blocks (`bb3`, `bb14`)**: These blocks handle error conditions (`fopen` failure, `read` failure) and are unlikely to execute often in normal scenarios.\n6. **`bb31`**: This is the function's exit block, executed only once, making it one of the least hot blocks."
