Blocks outside loops or those that serve as exit points are ranked lower. Blocks with conditional branches are ranked based on their likelihood of being executed.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb33.bb533_crit_edge` and `bb39.bb53_crit_edge` are less likely to be executed frequently as they serve as connectors between other blocks.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb304.loopexit` and `bb533.loopexit` are executed only once when exiting loops, so they are ranked lower."

Blocks closer to the innermost loop are ranked higher. Critical edges and exit blocks are less frequently executed, so they are ranked lower.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks like `bb28.bb103_crit_edge` and `bb103.bb28_crit_edge` are connectors and are executed less frequently than their parent blocks.\n4. **Exit Blocks**: Blocks like `bb361.loopexit` and `bb109.loopexit` are executed only once per loop exit, making them colder."
