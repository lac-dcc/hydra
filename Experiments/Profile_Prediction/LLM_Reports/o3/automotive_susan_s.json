Blocks like `bb74` and `bb` are less likely to execute frequently as they are exit or entry points.\n3. **Critical Edges**: Blocks with `.crit_edge` suffixes are less likely to be hot since they serve as intermediate transitions between other blocks."

    "additionalNotes": "- The hottest block is `bb11` because it is the header of a loop that iterates over the input arguments and performs significant computation. Loops are typically the hottest regions in a function.\n  - Blocks like `bb62`, `bb152`, and `bb160` are also hot because they are part of nested loops or are frequently revisited within the main loop.\n  - Blocks such as `bb598` and `bb417` are less hot because they are part of the function's cleanup and finalization, executed only once.\n  - Blocks like `bb6` and `bb7` are cold because they handle edge cases or early exits."
